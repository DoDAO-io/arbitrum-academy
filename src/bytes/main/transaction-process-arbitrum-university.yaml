      Arbitrum Nitro technology is designed to enhance efficiency and streamline
      workflows in the Ethereum ecosystem. When a user sends a transaction on
      the Nitro chain, it is signed with their wallet and given to the
      Sequencer. The Sequencer then orders the transactions and publishes them.

      After the transactions are published, they are processed to update the
      Nitro chain state, producing Layer 2 blocks as needed. The Sequencer uses
      a real-time alert system for immediate soft finality and batches
      transactions on the Ethereum chain for hard finality.

      Hard finality involves compressing transactions using 'brotli' and posting
      them to Ethereum. The finalization of these transactions on Ethereum
      ensures the sequence's immutability on Nitro.

    content: >-
      In the Nitro transaction lifecycle, the State Transition Function (STF) is
      crucial for updating the blockchain's state. Once a transaction is
      submitted, the STF processes these transactions, taking the current state
      and the transaction data to compute a new state.

    uuid: eb67c128-7a30-4af9-b239-188fe1e8b7e7
    content: >-
      The STF performs necessary calculations and state alterations in a
      deterministic manner, such as adjusting account balances and modifying
      smart contract states. This transition is then reflected on the chain,
      with the STF ensuring that the state progresses correctly after each
      transaction.

  - name: Data Posting
    uuid: 3fc988d1-6bc9-4630-bfae-a786918d52ad
    content: >-
      Data posting on Layer 1 is where transaction inputs are recorded as
      calldata on the Ethereum blockchain. This process supports the network's
      optimistic rollup approach, which assumes transactions as correct unless
      challenged within a roughly one-week period.

    content: >-
      If a block is unchallenged, it is confirmed, but disputed blocks trigger
      Arbitrum's dispute resolution protocol to determine accuracy, penalizing
      dishonest validators with deposit forfeiture. This design ensures the
      integrity of posted data while minimizing fraud.
