      Arbitrum Nitro is a significant technical upgrade for Arbitrum, a Layer 2
      scaling solution for Ethereum. It aims to lower transaction fees and
      increase the processing capacity of Ethereum by moving contract
      computation and storage from the primary chain.

    uuid: 762948b2-e6de-48f3-9707-f4cb49c24f0c
    content: >-
      Nitro introduces advanced calldata compression, reducing transaction costs
      even further. Nitro enhances the performance of Layer 1 (L1) nodes, aligns
      EVM operation pricing with Ethereum, and introduces additional
      synchronization with Ethereum L1 blocks.

          What are the primary benefits that Arbitrum Nitro brings to Ethereum's
          Layer 2 scaling?
        answerKeys:
          - B
        explanation: >-
          Arbitrum Nitro reduces transaction fees and increases Ethereum's
          processing capacity by enhancing EVM compatibility and calldata
          compression, thereby improving the user experience with lower costs
          and faster transactions.
