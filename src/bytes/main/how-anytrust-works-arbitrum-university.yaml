      The Arbitrum sequencer initiates the process by generating a data batch
      for submission and setting an expiration time, typically three weeks
      ahead. This batch data is then sent to all Committee members
      simultaneously via an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface.

      Upon receipt, each Committee member stores the data in its own backing
      store, using the data’s hash as an index for future retrieval. They then
      sign the pair consisting of the data’s hash and the expiration time using
      their individual BLS cryptographic keys.

      Each Committee member returns a signature accompanied by an indicator of
      successful storage. Once the sequencer receives the required number of
      signatures, it aggregates them to form a Data Availability Certificate
      (DACert) for the data batch.

    content: >-
      If the sequencer cannot obtain the necessary signatures within a specified
      time frame, it defaults to the traditional rollup method. This process
      ensures that the AnyTrust protocol can validate blocks efficiently while
      offering a contingency plan to maintain the chain's integrity and
      continuity.

  - name: Posting on L1
    uuid: e161e9a3-47ce-4127-b7dc-c17c9f4bf739
    content: >-
      In such a case, the sequencer posts the full data directly to the L1
      chain, bypassing the Committee. The L2 software is designed to recognize
      both data formats—either provided through a DACert or posted in full.
