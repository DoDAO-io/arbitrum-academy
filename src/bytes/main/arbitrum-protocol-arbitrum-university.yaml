      The Arbitrum Rollup Protocol is a Layer 2 scaling solution that works in
      conjunction with Ethereum's Layer 1. It doesn't decide the outcomes of
      transactions but instead confirms the results that are already determined
      by the sequence of messages in the chain's inbox.

      The protocol trustlessly verifies transactions and penalizes fraud,
      ensuring result accuracy and dispute resolution, while offloading Ethereum
      to scale operations beyond its native capacity thereby enhancing
      scalability.

      Once a transaction is included in the chainâ€™s inbox, its outcome is
      considered finalized and can be reported as complete. Arbitrum nodes
      validate these transactions, providing users the confidence that their
      transactions are processed without constant awareness of the protocol's
      operation.

      By only stepping in when a transaction is contested, Ethereum can ensure
      the integrity of the Arbitrum chain while enabling fast and cost-effective
      Layer 2 transactions.

        explanation: >-
          The Arbitrum Rollup Protocol serves as a trustless method to verify
          transaction results and to identify and penalize dishonest parties. It
          ensures the integrity of the Arbitrum chain while enabling fast and
          cost-effective Layer 2 transactions.

        answerKeys:
          - D
        explanation: >-
          The benefit of the Arbitrum Rollup Protocol is that it enhances the
          scalability of Ethereum by relieving it from the burden of processing
          every transaction. It also maintains the security of Ethereum by
          enabling the confirmation of transactions and the processing of
          withdrawals back to Layer 1.
