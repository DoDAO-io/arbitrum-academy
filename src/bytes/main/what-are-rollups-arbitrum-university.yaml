      Rollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling solution that execute transactions
      off-chain but record transaction data on the main chain. The core idea is
      to batch many transactions into a single one, then post to the main chain.
      This reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed on
      the main chain.

      There are two main types of rollups, each with its own approach to
      validating the batched transactions. These operate on the principle that
      all transactions are assumed to be valid by default. They only execute
      transaction computations on-chain in the event of a challenge.

      Optimistic Rollups post transactions with a bond and wait for a challenge
      period; if undisputed with a fraud proof, transactions are deemed valid,
      offering scaling benefits despite a potential delay in finality.

      ZK-Rollups combine transactions and create a zero-knowledge proof to
      confirm their validity on-chain, allowing for faster finalization than
      Optimistic Rollups, which require a challenge period. These enhance
      privacy since the actual transaction data is off-chain. This makes
      ZK-Rollups efficient and secure.
