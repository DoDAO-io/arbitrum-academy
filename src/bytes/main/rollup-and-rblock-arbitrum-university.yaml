      An RBlock on the Arbitrum Rollup includes its ID, the last verified RBlock
      number, the tally of L2 blocks, inbox message count, and a hash of
      outputs. These details are proposer claims awaiting validation. A new
      RBlock also confirms prior RBlocksâ€™ validity and disputes older ones.

    uuid: 9e9add6f-e6b6-4896-bce0-72aae42736c7
    content: >-
      Validators can challenge an RBlock before a deadline by proposing an
      alternative, which could lead to a staked conflict resolution. Validators
      propose RBlocks, which form a chain managed by the rollup protocol,
      distinct from Ethereum's Layer 1 and Nitro's Layer 2 blocks.

    content: >-
      When first proposed, RBlocks are 'unresolved' meaning their status as
      either confirmed or rejected has not yet been determined. Confirmed
      RBlocks are fully accepted and recorded by Ethereum's Layer 1 contracts.
      The most recent confirmed RBlock is known as the 'latest confirmed
      RBlock'.

    content: >-
      Newer RBlocks are proposed and remain unconfirmed until their resolution
      deadlines pass. Validators can propose new RBlocks based on the latest
      proposed (but not yet confirmed) RBlock, enabling the chain to grow
      continuously without waiting for each RBlock's confirmation.

  - name: Conflict Resolution
    uuid: e9adce5f-62ff-4546-8d57-69a431d7f825
    content: >-
      The proposed RBlocks are valid and thus are eventually confirmed. In cases
      where validators act maliciously by proposing incorrect RBlocks, the
      protocol can handle a  conflict by either confirming a fully accepted
      RBlock or discarding a rejected RBlock for being incorrect.

  - name: RBlock Rejection
    uuid: 04b6762f-3253-4667-acbd-79c5be5b05a6
    content: >-
      Subsequent RBlocks can be rejected due to incorrect claims or because they
      are built on other rejected RBlocks. Conflicts between RBlocks which claim
      the same predecessor, will be resolved by the protocol, with at least one
      being rejected.

    uuid: fa36fe8b-edb8-401e-b76f-261158628c8b
    content: >-
      Despite potential conflicts, the security property of the rollup protocol
      ensures that even if multiple parties act dishonestly, the correct chain
      execution will be confirmed, safeguarding the integrity of the rollup
      chain. If they propose a wrong RBlock, they will lose their stake,
      incentivizing honest behavior.
