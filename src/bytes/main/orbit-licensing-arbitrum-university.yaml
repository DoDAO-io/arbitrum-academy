      The licensing for Arbitrum Orbit chains is designed to provide security
      and flexibility for developers. When you create an Orbit chain, you
      receive a license that cannot be revoked and that allows your Orbit chain
      to host further chains under the same licensing terms.

    content: >-
      Licensing ensures that once you've developed your chain, you retain
      unfettered access to the software, and you can extend these rights to
      additional chains created within your Orbit chain's ecosystem. However,
      this license applies specifically to chains that settle to an
      Arbitrum-DAO-governed chain.

      If you wish to establish an independent Layer 2 chain on Ethereum that
      does not settle to an Arbitrum-DAO chain, you must obtain a separate
      license. You can directly request a custom license from Offchain Labs, the
      original developers of the Arbitrum Nitro codebase and the primary
      licensor.

      Alternatively, you can submit a proposal to the Arbitrum DAO, which has
      been granted co-licensor rights. The DAO will then make a democratic
      decision on whether to grant a license for your new L2 chain.
