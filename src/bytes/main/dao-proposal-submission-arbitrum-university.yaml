      A DAO proposal is a formalized suggestion put forward by a member of DAO,
      to make changes or take specific actions within the organization's
      ecosystem. The need for such proposals arises from the democratic nature
      of DAOs, where collective decision-making is fundamental.

      Proposals enable innovation, improvements, and community consensus on the
      evolution of the protocol or organization. They are essential for the
      transparent and equitable governance, allowing stakeholders to decide on
      the deployment of shared resources and strategic directions.

      There are two distinct categories of AIPs (Arbitrum Improvement Proposals)
      within the Arbitrum DAO framework based on the types of changes they
      initiate; Constitutional AIPs and Non-Constitutional AIPs.

      These are significant proposals that have the potential to alter the
      foundational rules and procedures of the Arbitrum ecosystem. They include
      changes to the text of the Constitution or to AIP-1, which lays out the
      initial rules for the governance process itself.

      These can also involve installing or modifying software on any of the
      chains or taking actions that necessitate 'chain owner' permissions, which
      typically means they require a higher level of authority and scrutiny due
      to their impact on the infrastructure and overall operation.

  - name: Non-Constitutional AIPs
    uuid: e6d5b7ad-c178-416e-8f2d-13ab16fe8701
    content: >-
      The second type encompasses proposals that are less structural in nature
      and do not involve amending the Constitution or AIP-1. They are usually
      operational or administrative, such as requests for funds or grants, or
      they may offer guidelines or disseminate information to the community.
    stepItems: []
  - name: Non-Constitutional AIPs Impact
    uuid: 0f5a841a-9c54-4c38-95b3-f022d0b623ff
    content: >-
      Non-Constitutional AIPs are generally more straightforward and often deal
      with the day-to-day governance and maintenance of the community's projects
      and initiatives.

          on the evolution of the protocol or organization. They are essential
          for the transparent and equitable governance of blockchain-based
