      The Arbitrum Bridge connects Ethereum's mainnet (Layer-1) with the
      Arbitrum chains (Layer-2). It allows for the secure and efficient transfer
      of assets. The bridge enhances scalability by mitigating congestion and
      grouping transactions to reduce gas fees significantly.

      Security is a top priority for the Arbitrum Bridge. It integrates
      Ethereum's security model and adds additional safeguards against malicious
      actions by validators. The bridge supports a wide range of assets,
      ensuring broad interoperability.

      When users want to transfer their assets, such as ETH or ERC-20 tokens, to
      Layer 2, they interact with the Arbitrum Bridge.

      The bridge locks the user's assets into a smart contract on Ethereum.
      Simultaneously, an equivalent amount of these assets is created or
      'minted' on the Arbitrum network. This process uses roll-up technology,
      reducing the amount of processing Ethereum has to do.

      For withdrawals from Arbitrum back to Ethereum, the process is reversed
      but includes an additional security step. The tokens on Arbitrum are burnt
      or destroyed to prevent double-spending. Correspondingly, the smart
      contract on Ethereum releases the initially locked funds.

      The transaction is not immediate due to a 'dispute period,' a week-long
      delay that allows for challenges and verification of the transaction's
      legitimacy on Ethereum before the assets are unlocked.
