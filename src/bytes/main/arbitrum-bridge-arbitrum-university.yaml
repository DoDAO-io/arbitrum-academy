      The Arbitrum Bridge connects Ethereum's mainnet (Layer-1) with the
      Arbitrum chains (Layer-2). It allows for the secure and efficient transfer
      of assets. The bridge enhances scalability by mitigating congestion and
      grouping transactions to reduce gas fees significantly.

      Security is a top priority for the Arbitrum Bridge. It integrates
      Ethereum's security model and adds additional safeguards against malicious
      actions by validators. The bridge supports a wide range of assets,
      ensuring broad interoperability.

      When users want to transfer their assets, such as ETH or ERC-20 tokens, to
      Layer 2, they interact with the Arbitrum Bridge.

      The bridge locks the user's assets into a smart contract on Ethereum.
      Simultaneously, an equivalent amount of these assets is created or
      'minted' on the Arbitrum network. This process uses roll-up technology,
      reducing the amount of processing Ethereum has to do.

    content: >-
      For withdrawals from Arbitrum back to Ethereum, the process is reversed
      but includes an additional security step. The tokens on Arbitrum are burnt
      or destroyed to prevent double-spending. Correspondingly, the smart
      contract on Ethereum releases the initially locked funds.

    content: >-
      The transaction is not immediate due to a 'dispute period,' a week-long
      delay that allows for challenges and verification of the transaction's
      legitimacy on Ethereum before the assets are unlocked.
