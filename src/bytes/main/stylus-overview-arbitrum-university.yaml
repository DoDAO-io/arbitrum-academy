      Stylus is a tool designed to enhance the development of smart contracts on
      the Arbitrum platform. It broadens the scope of smart contract creation on
      the Arbitrum platform by enabling developers to use a variety of
      programming languages that compile into WebAssembly (WASM).

      Programming languages such as Rust, C, and C++ can now be used to write
      EVM-compatible smart contracts. This is made possible through the Stylus
      Software Development Kit (SDK) and its accompanying command-line interface
      (CLI) tool.

      Stylus leverages Arbitrum's existing WASM infrastructure to ensure that
      these smart contracts benefit from the platform's efficient execution
      environment. This leads to faster performance and reduced gas costs.

      The efficiency gain is attributed to WASM's modern binary format, which is
      known for speed, portability, and security. Stylus represents an upgrade
      to Arbitrum Nitro, a technology stack that powers various Arbitrum chains.

      Stylus is part of the EVM+ paradigm, maintaining full interoperability
      with existing Solidity contracts. The innovation of Stylus lies in its
      ability to deterministically prove the correctness of any program that
      compiles to WASM.
