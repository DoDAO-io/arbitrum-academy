      Governance is the process by which decisions are made within an
      organization. In traditional setups, decisions are made by a small group
      chosen by the company's shareholders. These decisions may not always be
      transparent to the shareholders.

    content: >-
      Web3 technologies, like those in the Arbitrum ecosystem, start similarly
      but move towards a system where decision-making is spread out among its
      community. This aims to distribute power among stakeholders.

    content: >-
      Progressive decentralization is a process where control of a project
      shifts from a  central group to its wider community. This involves setting
      up a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and issuing governance
      tokens, empowering community members to make decisions.

  - name: DAO Formation
    uuid: f53fbc6c-b91a-466a-83f3-cc7e372ad019
    content: >-
      Entities like the Arbitrum DAO are created, taking over the governance of
      the network. The DAO operates based on a set of rules outlined in the
      Arbitrum DAO Constitution, which acts as a blueprint for its operations.

  - name: Governance Tokens
    uuid: 63c04518-fe02-4a5c-a906-978f9a6af137
    content: >-
      Ownership of governance tokens indicates membership in the DAO. Token
      holders, such as those holding $ARB, are eligible to vote on proposals
      affecting the network's future.

  - name: Smart Contracts
    uuid: d19123ce-e111-4c80-aee0-effb5e35dcbf
    content: >-
      DAO governance relies on transparent smart contracts instead of
      traditional legal contracts. These smart contracts execute the rules set
      out in the DAO Constitution and allow for trustless, decentralized
      decision-making.
