      AnyTrust security is a strategic balance between trust and
      decentralization, enhancing the robustness of Arbitrum's rollup
      infrastructure. It achieves this by establishing a Data Availability
      Committee, which strengthens data integrity and accessibility.

    uuid: beb90a07-cdb4-4d7a-ab39-e603a96f7e1a
    content: >-
      The Data Availability Committee is a group within the AnyTrust protocol.
      This group is responsible for storing and ensuring the accessibility of
      Layer 2 transaction data for Arbitrum's rollup chain. It operates under
      the assumption that at least two of its members are consistently honest.

    content: >-
      The committee's operation is governed by a set of cryptographic public
      keys, known as Keysets. These Keysets establish the identity and
      authenticity of member signatures. They are managed via a smart contract
      the KeysetManager, which authenticates the current valid set of committee
      members.

      This arrangement ensures the security and availability of transaction
      data. It also introduces a mechanism for manageable trust, reducing the
      dependency on Ethereum's mainnet and leading to a more efficient and
      cost-effective rollup process.

    content: >-
      The Data Availability Certificate (DACert) is a key component of the
      AnyTrust protocol, ensuring data accessibility in the Arbitrum network. A
      DACert includes a data block's hash, an expiration time, and cryptographic
      evidence that N-1 Committee members have endorsed it.

  - name: Trust Model
    uuid: c6cd0b8c-20ff-453d-8a50-e0ea34e53939
    content: >-
      Under AnyTrustâ€™s trust model, a valid DACert guarantees that the data will
      be available from at least one trustworthy Committee member until the
      expiration time. This allows for a more gas-efficient alternative to the
      standard Nitro practice of posting full data on Ethereum's Layer 1.

  - name: Validation Process
    uuid: 0ce51a0b-b6ea-41ac-8aa9-b0b092f0b5a9
    content: >-
      The Layer 1 inbox contract validates the Keyset, while Layer 2 code
      performs additional checks on the signature and expiration time to ensure
      the DACert's validity. If the DACert passes these checks, the associated
      data block is considered available, thereby reducing the on-chain
      footprint and maintaining data availability.
