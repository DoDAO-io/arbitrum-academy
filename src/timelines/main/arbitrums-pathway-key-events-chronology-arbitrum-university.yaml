      Circle is launching USDC natively on Arbitrum on June 8, 2023, replacing
      the current bridged USDC from Ethereum. This native version will be fully
      reserved, redeemable 1:1 for US dollars, and will support institutional
      on/off-ramps and future enhancements via an upgradeable smart contract. To
      distinguish between the versions, the Ethereum-bridged USDC will be

      gradual, with Arbitrum working with ecosystem apps for smooth liquidity
      migration. Additionally, Circle plans to introduce the Cross-Chain
      Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to Arbitrum post-launch, enabling faster USDC
      transfers between Ethereum and other chains, significantly improving
      transaction efficiency in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
