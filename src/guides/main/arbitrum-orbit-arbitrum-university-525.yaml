      ## What is Orbit?

      Arbitrum Orbit enables the creation of private blockchain chains with
      customizable features, such as governance and fee structures, which settle
      transactions on Arbitrum's Layer 2 ecosystems like Arbitrum One or Nova.
      It utilizes the Arbitrum Nitro technology stack, offering benefits like
      Nitro's fraud proofs, advanced data compression, and EVM+ compatibility,
      while also allowing for ongoing upgrades from the Nitro stack
      developments. Orbit chains can be tailored for specific applications or
      broader use cases, offering gas price stability, permissioned access, and
      the choice between Rollup or AnyTrust protocols. Governance is
      independently determined by the chain creators, providing a flexible,
      scalable, and secure platform for hosting a range of dApps or private
      EVM-compatible smart contracts, with the ability to incrementally adopt
      Ethereum's security features.

      ## Benefits of Orbit

      Arbitrum Orbit addresses several key challenges within the Ethereum
      ecosystem:


      **1. Scalability:** Orbit facilitates scalability by allowing the creation
      of multiple chains. This helps alleviate scaling challenges by
      distributing activities across various environments, each with its own
      resource management, thereby easing bottlenecks that could arise on a
      single chain.


      **2. Flexible Security Models**: With Orbit, developers can implement and
      test different security models to find the right balance for their
      projects. For instance, while Arbitrum One offers a fully trustless
      environment, Arbitrum Nova provides an option to optimize for lower fees
      with a mild trust assumption. Orbit extends this flexibility, making
      experimentation with security tradeoffs more accessible.


      **3. Flexible Execution Environments**: Orbit chains allow for customized
      execution environments. While maintaining full EVM compatibility, Orbit
      chains can also limit smart contract functionalities to better serve
      specific project requirements, leading to optimized performance.

      </div>


      **4. Flexible Governance**: Developers have the autonomy to establish
      their own governance mechanisms on Orbit chains, which can be tailored to
      suit the unique needs of their projects, communities, or stakeholders.


      **5. Increased Adoption of dApps**: Orbit lowers barriers to progressive
      decentralization, making it more feasible for developers to launch
      decentralized applications. It enables a new breed of dApps that benefit
      from being built in more autonomous, self-managed conditions, potentially
      increasing the adoption and diversity of dApps within the blockchain
      space.

      ## Orbit Licensing 

      The licensing for Arbitrum Orbit chains is designed to provide both
      security and flexibility for developers using the Arbitrum Nitro codebase.
      When you create an Orbit chain, you receive a license that is both
      perpetual, meaning it cannot be revoked, and recursive, allowing your
      Orbit chain to host further chains under the same licensing terms. This
      ensures that once you've developed your Orbit chain, you retain unfettered
      and ongoing access to the software, and you can extend these rights to
      additional chains created within your Orbit chain's ecosystem.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_orbit_arbitrum_university_525/1701179466748_licensing.png"/>
      </div>


      However, this license applies specifically to chains that settle to an
      Arbitrum-DAO-governed chain. If you wish to establish an independent Layer
      2 chain on Ethereum that does not settle to an Arbitrum-DAO chain, you
      must obtain a separate license. For this, you have two avenues:


      **1. Offchain Labs**: You can directly request a custom license from
      Offchain Labs, the original developers of the Arbitrum Nitro codebase and
      the primary licensor.


      **2. Arbitrum DAO Proposal**: Alternatively, you can submit a proposal to
      the Arbitrum DAO, which has been granted co-licensor rights. The DAO will
      then make a democratic decision on whether to grant a license for your new
      L2 chain.


      ## How to customize your Orbit chain's deployment configuration?

      To customize your Orbit chain's configuration, follow these steps when you
      access the Orbit chain deployment portal:


      ### Step1: Access the Deployment Portal

      Navigate to the Orbit chain deployment portal where you'll launch your new
      Orbit chain. You will encounter a form with various configuration fields.
      This form typically comes with default values that are suitable for many
      cases but can be customized.


      ### Step 2: Update Information

      For devnets, the Chain ID is automatically assigned and isn't crucial. In
      production, you'll choose a unique integer identifier that hasnâ€™t been
      used on chain indexes like Chainlist.org. Enter a distinctive name for
      your Orbit chain that is easily recognizable to your users and developers.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_orbit_arbitrum_university_525/1701179515385_configuration.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Step 3: Customise Specifications

      Decide on the Challenge period in blocks, balancing the time validators
      have to dispute states against the withdrawal delay for users. This is
      measured in blocks of the underlying L1 chain. Specify the token for
      validators to use as a stake, using the token's contract address on the L2
      chain to which your Orbit chain settles, or use the address for ETH if
      that's the chosen stake token. Set the Base stake amount, considering that
      a lower stake lowers the barrier to entry but may increase vulnerability
      to attacks, while a higher stake deters attacks but raises the barrier to
      validator participation.


      ### Step 4: Owner

      Provide the account address that will own and manage the Orbit chain's
      base contracts. In a production environment, this address might be
      governed by a DAO or a multisig, but for a devnet, it can be a standard
      Ethereum wallet address. Carefully review the default values and modify
      them based on the needs and security considerations of your project. Once
      you've finalized the configuration values, proceed with the deployment,
      ensuring that the Owner address has sufficient ETH to cover gas costs for
      contract deployment on L2.


      By customizing these settings, you can tailor your Orbit chain to the
      specific requirements of your application, balancing security,
      participation, and administrative control according to your project's
      needs.

      ## Steps to launch an Orbit Chain


      ### Prerequisites


      - Docker


      - A browser-based Ethereum wallet (like MetaMask)


      - At least 1.5 testnet ETH


      ### Step 1: Aqcuire Arbitrum Testnet $ETH

      To initiate your Orbit chain, a minimum of 1.5 testnet ETH is required to
      fund the deployment of the foundational contracts to the chosen base
      chain, which can be either Arbitrum Goerli or Sepolia. With Sepolia being
      the preferred choice due to the planned obsolescence of Goerli, you should
      secure your testnet ETH from an Ethereum Layer 1 faucet for either Goerli
      or Sepolia. Once obtained, you can transfer your L1 testnet ETH to the
      corresponding Arbitrum Layer 2 testnet through the Arbitrum bridge.


      ### Step 2: Choose Chain Type: Anytrust vs Roll up

      Arbitrum Rollup ensures a secure, open validation process by storing data
      on Ethereum L1, while Arbitrum AnyTrust reduces fees through a trusted
      Data Availability Committee managing data off-chain. Rollup chains are
      recommended for highly secure applications such as DeFi platforms, while
      AnyTrust is better suited for transaction-intensive applications like
      games and social dApps that prioritize lower fees. Then Configure the
      orbit chain's deployment using the step by step guide available in the
      previous slide.


      ### Step 3: Configure Validators and batch Poster

      In the Configure Validators section of the Orbit chain deployment, you'll
      specify the number of validators and their addresses for your chain. The
      first validator's address is auto-generated, with its private key saved in
      a configuration file. These validators will ensure transaction integrity
      and manage the state of your Orbit chain on the base chain. They will be
      included in an allow-list on your chain's base contract, granting them
      permission to stake and validate. The terms "base contracts" and "base
      chain" refer to the L2 contracts of your Orbit chain and the L2 network
      they're deployed on, respectively. After setting up validators, you'll
      move on to configure the batch poster. In the Configure Batch Poster
      section, an address for the batch poster will be auto-generated,
      responsible for posting transaction batches from your Orbit chain to its
      base chain's contracts. Its private key is also auto-generated and stored
      in a JSON configuration file. After configuring this address, you proceed
      to the next deployment phase of your Orbit chain.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_orbit_arbitrum_university_525/1701183863381_launching.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Step 4: Deploye Orbit Chain

      To deploy your Orbit chain's base contracts, click the Deploy button on
      the configuration form, which prompts a transaction submission to the
      Arbitrum Goerli or Sepolia testnet from your wallet, incurring a minor gas
      fee payable in testnet ETH. This action deploys your chain's base
      contracts through an Orbit factory contract on Arbitrum's L2 testnet,
      which sets up your chain's infrastructure for transaction processing,
      staking, and other critical operations. After completing this transaction,
      you'll either move to configure a keyset for an AnyTrust chain or proceed
      to download configuration files to launch your chain, depending on your
      chosen chain type.


      ### Step 5: Keysets Configuration (Anytrust Only)

      The Batch Poster's functionality hinges on activating a keyset in the
      SequencerInbox contract, using keyset and hash binaries. For Orbit
      AnyTrust chains, an initial keyset is generated and linked to the
      SequencerInbox during deployment. Post-deployment, completing a
      transaction with a gas fee on the Arbitrum testnet redirects you to a
      download page to advance your chain's setup.


      ### Step 6: Set Up Orbit Chain's Local Development Environment

      After deploying your Orbit chain, you'll be presented with two JSON
      configurations: Rollup Config and L3 Config. You should download both:


      1. **Rollup Config**: Saves as `nodeConfig.json`, containing your chain's
      node settings and the private keys for the validator and batch poster to
      sign transactions.


      2. **L3Config**: Saves as `orbitSetupScriptConfig.json`, holding your
      chain's overall settings, including those for Token Bridge contracts.


      Next, to set up your local environment:


      1. Clone the `orbit-setup-script` repository from GitHub.

      2. Place the `nodeConfig.json` file into the `config` directory of the
      cloned repository.

      3. Similarly, move the `orbitSetupScriptConfig.json` file into the
      `config` directory.

      4. Install necessary dependencies by executing `yarn install` in the
      repository's root directory. 


      ### Step 7: Finish Setting up Chain

      Start Docker and execute `docker-compose up -d` in the orbit-setup-script
      repository's root directory to initiate a Nitro node and BlockScout
      explorer. You can then navigate to `http://localhost:4000/` to interact
      with the BlockScout explorer, enabling you to inspect transactions and
      blocks on your chain for debugging purposes. A provided Hardhat script
      automates several setup tasks, including funding validator and
      batch-poster accounts, depositing ETH through the bridge, deploying Token
      Bridge contracts, and setting chain parameters. Execute this script from
      the orbit-setup-script repository's root, substituting `0xYourPrivateKey`
      with your Owner account's private key and the local RPC URL with your
      node's. 


      - For Arbitrum Goerli, use

      `PRIVATE_KEY="0xYourPrivateKey"
      L2_RPC_URL="https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc"
      L3_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8449" yarn run setup`. 


      - For Arbitrum Sepolia, 

      `PRIVATE_KEY="0xYourPrivateKey"
      L2_RPC_URL="https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc"
      L3_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8449" yarn run setup`.

      ## How to Customise Orbit Chain's Behaviour 

      Modifying your Orbit chain's State Transition Function (STF), responsible
      for block generation, requires updating the fraud proof system for changes
      like new EVM opcodes or gas rules to be recognized. Simple updates, like
      adding RPC methods or altering transaction order, don't impact consensus
      and don't need these adjustments. To be compatible with Arbitrum Nitro,
      STF changes must ensure determinism, preserve historical block integrity,
      avoid external dependencies, confine state changes to Ethereum's state
      trie, maintain quick processing for node synchronization, and consistently
      produce blocks without errors.

      If you're looking to alter the State Transition Function, it's necessary
      to create a custom version of the Arbitrum Nitro node Docker image. The
      behaviour of an orbit chain can be customised by following the steps given
      below:


      ### Step 1: Download Nitro Source Code

      Start by duplicating the Nitro repository:


      `git clone --branch v2.1.1 https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro.git

      cd nitro

      git submodule update --init --recursive --force

      `


      Proceed to apply your modifications to the State Transition Function.


      ### Step 2: Run Node Without Fraud Proof

      For building the custom Arbitrum Nitro node Docker image, ensure Docker is
      installed by checking with docker version in the terminal. If it's not
      installed, refer to Docker's official guide or install it using your Linux
      distribution's package manager and enable the Docker service. With Docker
      ready, navigate to the Nitro directory and build your custom node using
      the command `docker build . --tag custom-nitro-node`. After constructing
      your Nitro node image, edit your node's `nodeConfig.json` file, typically
      in the `config` directory, to include the
      `--node.staker.dangerous.without-block-validator` parameter under the
      staker configuration to bypass fraud proof checks.

      Here's an example snippet for the nodeConfig.json:

      `...

      "staker": {
        ...
        "dangerous": {
          "without-block-validator": true
        }
        ...
      },

      ...

      `

      You can launch your node in two ways:


      1. Via docker-compose: Update the docker-compose.yml file to use
      custom-nitro-node for the Nitro service, then execute docker compose up to
      start all services.

      `...

      nitro:
        image: custom-nitro-node
        ports:
      ...

      `

      2. Directly with docker run: To run just the Nitro node, use:

      `docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/your/node/dir:/home/user/.arbitrum -p
      0.0.0.0:8449:8449 custom-nitro-node --conf.file
      /home/user/.arbitrum/nodeConfig.json`


      ### Step 3: Enable Fraud Proof

      To enable fraud proofs, you'll need to build the "replay binary", which
      defines the State Transition Function for the fraud prover. The replay
      binary (sometimes called the machine) re-executes the State Transition
      Function against input messages to determine the correct output block. It
      has three forms:


      The replay.wasm binary is the Go replay binary compiled to WASM. It's used
      by the JIT validator to verify blocks against the fraud prover.

      The machine.wavm.br binary is a compressed binary containing the Go replay
      binary and all its dependencies, compiled to WASM, then translated to the
      Arbitrum fraud proving variant WAVM. It's used by Arbitrator when actually
      entering a challenge and performing the fraud proofs, and has identical
      behavior to replay.wasm.

      The WASM module root (stored in module-root.txt) is a 32 byte hash usually
      expressed in hexadecimal which is a merkelization of machine.wavm.br. The
      replay binary is much too large to post on-chain, so this hash is set in
      the L1 rollup contract to determine the correct replay binary during fraud
      proofs.

      To run a validator node with fraud proofs enabled, the validator node's
      Docker image will need to contain all three of these versions of the
      replay binary.


      #### Build a dev image

      The simplest way to build a Docker image with the new replay binary is to
      build a dev image. These images contain a freshly built replay binary, but
      note that the replay binary and corresponding WASM module root will
      generally change when the code is updated, even if the State Transition
      Function has equivalent behavior. It's important that the validator's WASM
      module root matches the on-chain WASM module root, which is why this
      approach is harder to maintain. Over the longer term, you'll want to
      maintain a separate build of the replay binary that matches the one
      currently on-chain, usable by any node image.


      To build the dev node image and get the WASM module root, run:


      `docker build . --target nitro-node-dev --tag custom-nitro-node-dev

      docker run --rm --entrypoint cat custom-nitro-node-dev
      target/machines/latest/module-root.txt`


      Once you have the WASM module root, you can put it on-chain by calling
      `setWasmModuleRoot(newWasmModuleRoot)` on the rollup contract as the
      owner. The rollup contract address can be found in the chain deployment
      info JSON. You can confirm that the WASM module root was updated by
      calling `wasmModuleRoot()` on the rollup contract.


      Once you have set the new WASM module root on-chain, you can re-enable
      fraud proofs and run your node.


      To re-enable fraud proofs, open your `nodeConfig.json` file again, and
      remove the "dangerous" section (containing the `without-block-validator`
      property) that you previously added.


      After that, you'll have, again, two ways of running your node.


      1. Using the docker-compose file


      As mentioned before, this is the recommended way if you're running your
      Orbit chain locally through the provided docker-compose file. In
      `docker-compose.yml`, modify the Docker image used for the Nitro
      container. Notice that we'll now use the `custom-nitro-node-dev` you just
      created:


      `...

      nitro:
        image: custom-nitro-node-dev
        ports:
      ...`


      And run docker compose up to run all of your containers.


      2. Use docker run to run your Nitro node only


      This method will only run the customized Nitro node (i.e., it will not run
      Blockscout, or the DA server if you're using an AnyTrust chain). Use the
      following command:


      `docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/your/node/dir:/home/user/.arbitrum -p
      0.0.0.0:8449:8449 custom-nitro-node-dev --conf.file
      /home/user/.arbitrum/nodeConfig.json`



      ####  Preserving the replay binary

      The primary issue with simply using a nitro-node-dev build is that,
      whenever the code changes at all, the replay binary will also change.


      If the node is missing the replay binary corresponding to the on-chain
      WASM module root, it will be unable to act as a validator. Therefore, when
      releasing new node Docker images it's important to include the currently
      on-chain WASM module root.


      To do that, you'll need to first extract the replay binary from the
      nitro-node-dev Docker image built earlier:


      `docker run --rm --name replay-binary-extractor --entrypoint sleep
      custom-nitro-node-dev infinity

      docker cp replay-binary-extractor:/home/user/target/machines/latest
      extracted-replay-binary

      docker stop replay-binary-extractor

      cat extracted-replay-binary/module.root

      mv extracted-replay-binary "target/machines/$(cat
      extracted-replay-binary/module.root)"`


      These commands will output the new WASM module root, and create the
      directory `target/machines/<wasm module root>.` There you'll find the
      three versions of the replay binary mentioned earlier: `replay.wasm`,
      `machine.wavm.br`, and `module-root.txt`, along with some other optional
      files. Now that you've extracted the replay binary, there are two ways to
      add it to future Docker images, including non-dev image builds. You can
      either keep it locally and copy it in, or host it on the web.


      Option 1: Store the extracted replay binary locally

      Now that we've extracted the replay binary, we can modify the `Dockerfile`
      to copy it into new Docker builds. Edit the Dockerfile file in the root of
      the nitro folder, and after all the `RUN ./download-machines.sh ...`
      lines, add:


      `COPY target/machines/<wasm module root> <wasm module root>

      RUN ln -sfT <wasm module root> latest`


      Replace each `<wasm module root>` with the WASM module root you got
      earlier.


      Option 2: Host the replay binary on the web

      To support building the Docker image on other computers without this local
      machine directory, you'll need to either commit the machine to git, or
      preferably, host the replay binary on the web.


      To host the replay binary on the web, you'll need to host the
      `replay.wasm` and `machine.wavm.br` files somewhere. One good option is
      GitHub releases, but any hosting service works.


      Once you have those two files hosted, instead of the `COPY` and `RUN`
      command mentioned in option 1, you'll need to add these new lines to the
      Dockerfile file in the root of the nitro folder, after all the `RUN
      ./download-machines.sh ...` lines:


      `RUN wasm_module_root="<wasm module root>" && \
          mkdir "$wasm_module_root" && \
          wget <url of replay.wasm> -O "$wasm_module_root/replay.wasm" && \
          wget <url of machine.wavm.br> -O "$wasm_module_root/machine.wavm.br" && \
          echo "$wasm_module_root" > "$wasm_module_root/module-root.txt" && \
          ln -sfT "$wasm_module_root" latest`

      Replace the `<wasm module root>` with the WASM module root you got
      earlier, the `<url of replay.wasm>` with the direct link to the
      `replay.wasm` file (it must be a direct link to the file and not just a
      download site), and the `<url of machine.wavm.br>` with the direct link to
      the `machine.wavm.br` file.


      ### Step 4: Verify Fraud Proofs

      With your Docker images ready, test your blockchain by making transactions
      and monitoring for "validation succeeded" in the logs, indicating the
      State Transition Function is working. If you encounter "Error during
      validation," check that your replay binary is updated with your latest
      changes and the WASM module root in the rollup contract is correctly set
      to match your binary.


      ## Chain Parameters

      Chain parameters define the essential rules and configurations for a
      blockchain network, such as block size, block time, consensus rules, and
      network IDs, ensuring that all nodes on the network are in sync and follow
      the same protocol for validating and adding transactions. They are
      critical for maintaining the blockchain's integrity and security.
