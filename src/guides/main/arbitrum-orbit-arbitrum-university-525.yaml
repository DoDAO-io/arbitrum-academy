      ## What is Arbitrum Oribit


      Arbitrum Orbit is a product that allows you to create your own dedicated
      chain that settles to one of Arbitrum's Layer 2 (L2) chains. These L2
      chains include Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, Arbitrum Goerli, and Arbitrum
      Sepolia. With Arbitrum Orbit, you have full ownership and control over
      your chain. You can customize its privacy settings, permissions, fee
      token, governance, and more.


      ## Why do we need it?


      #### Gas Price Reliability


      One of the key benefits of using Arbitrum Orbit is the gas price
      reliability it offers to end-users. The dedicated throughput and traffic
      isolation provided by Orbit chains ensure that your users can enjoy
      consistent and predictable gas prices. This is particularly useful in the
      Ethereum ecosystem, where network congestion often leads to high gas fees
      and delays.


      #### Control on Permission Access


      Another advantage of Arbitrum Orbit is the ability to implement permission
      access. You can decide who can read your chain's data and who can deploy
      smart contracts to your chain. This allows you to create a completely
      permissionless chain like Ethereum and Arbitrum One, or you can set up
      your own permissions policies according to your specific requirements.


      #### Token of Choice


      Arbitrum Orbit also allows you to collect fees using a token of your
      choice. This gives you the flexibility to experiment with different
      mechanism designs and capture value in a way that aligns with your
      business goals. Additionally, Orbit chains are built on top of Arbitrum's
      L2 Nitro technology stack, which incorporates fraud proofs, advanced
      compression, EVM+ compatibility via Stylus, and continuous improvements.

      ## Importance of Orbit Chains


      The Orbit Chain is of great importance because it is a valuable tool for
      developers and users of decentralized applications (dApps). 


      #### Dedicated Throughput


      One of the key advantages is dedicated throughput. By running a dApp on
      its own Orbit chain, developers can ensure high-performance and consistent
      resource availability. This means they don't have to compete for
      computation and storage resources, resulting in a smoother and more
      efficient user experience.


      #### Compatible to EVM+


      Another significant benefit is EVM+ compatibility. Orbit chains support
      the same EVM+ compatibility as Stylus, allowing developers to deploy
      EVM-compatible smart contracts using popular programming languages like
      Solidity, C, C++, and Rust. This eliminates the need to migrate to a new
      language or toolchain, making it easier for developers to continue using
      their preferred technologies.


      #### Independent Product Roadmap


      Orbit chains also offer an independent product roadmap. This means that
      developers can decouple their app chain's roadmap from that of Ethereum
      and/or Arbitrum. By doing so, they can implement cutting-edge features and
      innovations ahead of projects following Ethereum's public roadmap. This
      flexibility allows developers to stay ahead of the curve and deliver
      unique and advanced functionalities to their users.


      #### Increased Gas Price Reliability


      Orbit chains provide increased gas price reliability. Gas prices can
      greatly impact the cost and efficiency of dApps. By using Orbit chains,
      developers can isolate their dApp from the on-chain activity of other
      apps, ensuring more reliable gas prices. This predictability allows
      developers to model and predict business costs accurately, making it
      easier to experiment with cost-prohibitive mechanisms and deliver
      decentralized experiences that feel familiar to non-technical audiences.


      #### Customizable fee Tokens


      Orbit chains offer customizable fee tokens and protocol logic. Developers
      have the freedom to choose any token as the fee token, facilitating
      seamless integration with their dApp's ecosystem. They can also modify the
      logic of their chain's settlement, execution, or governance protocols to
      meet specific requirements. This customization allows developers to tailor
      their dApps to their unique needs and create a more optimized and
      efficient user experience.
