      ## Arbitrum Nova?


      Arbitrum Nova is a high-performance alternative to Arbitrum One's chain.
      While Arbitrum One focuses on pure trustlessness through the Rollup
      protocol, Arbitrum Nova implements the AnyTrust protocol, which introduces
      an additional trust assumption in the form of a Data Availability
      Committee (DAC). This committee is responsible for storing, batching, and
      posting L2 transaction data to Ethereum's L1, expediting the process and
      improving performance and affordability. AnyTrust manages data off-chain,
      relying on the committee members to provide the necessary data in case of
      a challenge. This off-chain approach allows AnyTrust to offer lower fees,
      making it a sensible tradeoff for applications that require high
      transaction throughput but don't need the full decentralization provided
      by rollups.


      #### Use Cases and Focus


      Arbitrum Nova is tailored for building social applications and gaming. The
      new chain aims to help creators tackle scalability, privacy, and
      speed-related issues. By implementing optimistic rollup technology,
      Arbitrum Nova offers faster transactions, lower fees, and robust
      Ethereum-based security benefits for Web3 developers. It provides full
      access to the EVM environment, allowing developers to test out the new
      technology and explore a broader range of use cases.


      #### Transaction Data Handling


      Arbitrum Nova utilizes the AnyTrust technology introduced in early 2022,
      which significantly reduces transaction costs by only putting data
      on-chain if the committee fails to perform its function. This approach
      makes it ideal for projects with high transaction volume expectations,
      such as gaming and social platforms. The creators of Arbitrum Nova also
      plan to implement further improvements to reduce transaction costs over
      time, ensuring that the chain remains efficient and cost-effective for
      developers.

      ## What is AnyTrust?


      AnyTrust is a variant of the Arbitrum Nitro technology that aims to lower
      costs and improve efficiency by accepting a mild trust assumption. It
      operates by relying on an external Data Availability Committee (DAC) to
      store data and provide it when needed. The DAC consists of N members, with
      the assumption that at least two of them are honest.


      #### The Role of the Data Availability Committee


      The Data Availability Committee plays a crucial role in the AnyTrust
      protocol. It stores the data and ensures its availability for the rollup
      protocol to function correctly. If N-1 Committee members promise to
      provide access to certain data, it guarantees that at least one of the
      promising parties is honest, ensuring the availability of the data.


      #### Keysets and Membership Changes


      To facilitate membership changes and provide flexibility to Committee
      members, AnyTrust utilizes Keysets. A Keyset specifies the public keys of
      Committee members and the number of signatures required for a Data
      Availability Certificate to be valid. The L1 KeysetManager contract
      maintains a list of currently valid Keysets, allowing the contents to be
      recovered later by anyone given only the Keyset hash.


      ## Purpose of AnyTrust


      #### Lowering Costs and Improving Efficiency


      The main goal of AnyTrust is to reduce costs and speed up non-fungible
      withdrawals in the common case. By keeping the data off-chain in the
      happy/common case, the system can charge users significantly lower fees.
      This is achieved by leveraging the trust assumption and relying on the
      Committee to store and provide data on demand.

      ## What is a Data Availability Certificate (DACerts)


      Data Availability Certificates (DACerts) are an essential component of
      AnyTrust, a system that ensures the availability of data in a
      decentralized network. A DACert serves as proof that a specific block's
      data will be accessible from at least one honest Committee member until a
      specified expiration time. It consists of a BLS aggregated signature,
      which demonstrates that N-1 Committee members have signed the (hash,
      expiration time) pair. By utilizing DACerts, AnyTrust enhances the
      trustworthiness and availability of data in the decentralized network. It
      provides a mechanism to ensure that data blocks can be accessed by at
      least one honest Committee member, thereby increasing the reliability of
      the system. DACerts offer a valuable solution for maintaining data
      availability and integrity in decentralized environments.


      #### How is it different from Nitro System? 


      In the traditional Nitro system, data blocks are posted on the L1 chain as
      calldata, and their hashes are committed by the L1 Inbox contract. This
      allows the data to be reliably read by L2 code. However, AnyTrust
      introduces an additional option for the sequencer to post a data block on
      L1: using a DACert to prove the availability of the data.


      #### Verification of DACert


      When a DACert is submitted to the L1 inbox contract, it undergoes
      validation checks. The contract ensures that the DACert uses a valid
      Keyset, while other aspects of DACert validity are verified by the L2
      code. These checks include confirming that the number of signers meets the
      requirements of the Keyset and that the expiration time is at least two
      weeks after the current L2 timestamp. If a DACert is found to be invalid
      during the validation process, the L2 code discards it and proceeds to the
      next data block. However, if the DACert is valid, the L2 code reads the
      associated data block, which is guaranteed to be available due to the
      DACert's validity.

      ## Overview of Data Availability Servers (DAS)


      Data Availability Servers (DAS) play a crucial role in ensuring the
      availability and accessibility of data blocks. DAS software empowers
      deployments to optimize data availability, durability, and performance
      according to their specific needs.


      #### Sequencer API: Submitting Data Blocks for Storage


      The Sequencer API is a JSON-RPC interface specifically designed for the
      Arbitrum chain's Sequencer. Its primary function is to allow the Sequencer
      to submit data blocks to the Data Availability Servers (DAS) for storage.
      This API is meant to be accessed exclusively by the Sequencer, and
      deployments typically restrict access to other callers. By utilizing the
      Sequencer API, the DAS ensures that only authorized entities can submit
      data blocks for storage, enhancing security and data integrity.


      #### REST API: Fetching Data Blocks by Hash


      In contrast to the Sequencer API, the REST API is intended to be available
      to the world. It is a RESTful HTTP(S) based protocol that enables users to
      fetch data blocks by their respective hash values. This API is fully
      cacheable, meaning that deployments can leverage caching proxies or
      Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to enhance scalability and protect
      against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. By making data blocks accessible
      through the REST API, the DAS ensures that users can retrieve specific
      data blocks efficiently and securely.


      ## Features of DAS


      #### Flexible Data Storage Options


      The DAS software offers a range of configuration options for storing data.
      Depending on the deployment's requirements, the software can store data in
      local files, a Badger database, Amazon S3, or redundantly across multiple
      backing stores. This flexibility allows deployments to choose the storage
      solution that best suits their needs, whether it's leveraging existing
      infrastructure or utilizing cloud-based storage services. By providing
      multiple storage options, the DAS ensures that deployments can optimize
      data availability and durability according to their specific requirements.


      #### Optional Caching for Improved Performance


      To further enhance performance, the DAS software supports optional caching
      mechanisms. It can cache data in memory using Bigcache or in a Redis
      instance. By caching data, the DAS minimizes the need for repeated data
      retrieval, improving response times and overall system efficiency. This
      optional caching feature is particularly beneficial for deployments that
      require frequent access to specific data blocks, as it reduces the
      reliance on disk-based storage and accelerates data retrieval.

      ## Sequencer Committee Interaction


      In the Arbitrum ecosystem, the Sequencer Committee plays a crucial role in
      ensuring the smooth functioning of data posting. This interaction involves
      the sequencer, committee members, and the L2 software. By following this
      process, data batches are securely stored, signed, and made available for
      further processing. In case of any issues, the fallback mechanism ensures
      the continuity of data posting. This seamless interaction ensures the
      efficient functioning of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Let's delve into the
      process and understand how it works.


      #### Data Batch Posting


      When the Arbitrum sequencer wants to post a data batch using the
      Committee, it sends the batch's data and an expiration time to all
      Committee members simultaneously. This is done through a process called
      Remote Procedure Call (RPC). The expiration time is typically set to three
      weeks in the future.


      #### Storage and Signing


      Upon receiving the data, each Committee member stores it in its own
      backing store, organizing it by the data's hash. Additionally, the member
      signs the (hash, expiration time) pair using its BLS key. The signature,
      along with a success indicator, is then sent back to the sequencer.


      #### Signature Aggregation


      Once the sequencer has collected enough signatures from the Committee
      members, it can aggregate them to create a valid DACert (Data Availability
      Certificate) for the (hash, expiration time) pair. This DACert is a
      crucial component for data availability in the Arbitrum ecosystem.


      ####  Posting to L1 Inbox Contract


      The sequencer proceeds to post the DACert to the L1 inbox contract. By
      doing so, the DACert becomes accessible to the AnyTrust chain software at
      L2. This step ensures that the data is securely transferred and available
      for further processing within the Arbitrum ecosystem.


      #### Fallback to Rollup


      In the event that the sequencer fails to collect enough signatures within
      a few minutes, it will abandon the attempt to use the Committee. Instead,
      it will "fall back to rollup" by directly posting the full data to the L1
      chain. This fallback mechanism ensures that data is not lost and can still
      be processed in a non-AnyTrust chain scenario.

      ## Differences between Arbitrum Nova (AnyTrust) and Arbitrum One (Rollup)


      Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One are two different chains within the
      Arbitrum ecosystem, each with its own unique features and characteristics.
      These differences provide users with options based on their specific needs
      and preferences within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Let's explore the
      differences between them.


      #### Data Availability 


      In Arbitrum One, all Layer 2 transaction data is posted on the Ethereum
      blockchain, allowing validators to verify the authenticity of
      transactions. On the other hand, Arbitrum Nova uses a different technology
      called AnyTrust, where a Data Availability Committee (DAC) stores
      transaction data and provides it to validators through Data Availability
      Certificates (DACerts). This means that only the certificates are posted
      on Layer 1, rather than the full transaction data.


      #### Trust Assumption


      Arbitrum One is trustless and permissionless, meaning that anyone can
      participate in validating the chain and ensuring its safety. However,
      Arbitrum Nova introduces a trust assumption by relying on the honesty of
      at least two members of the Data Availability Committee. If this
      assumption is met, the system operates without posting the L2 chain's data
      on L1, resulting in significantly lower fees for users.


      #### Gas Price and Scalability


      The minimum allowed gas price on Arbitrum Nova is 0.01 gwei, while on
      Arbitrum One it is 0.1 gwei. This means that transactions on Arbitrum Nova
      can cost 10 times less than on Arbitrum One, even if they require the same
      amount of computation effort. Additionally, Nova is designed to be more
      scalable, making it a suitable choice for high-load decentralized
      applications (dApps) like NFT-based games and Web3 social networks.


      #### DeFi Protocols


      Both Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One support various decentralized finance
      (DeFi) protocols. However, Arbitrum One currently has a higher Total Value
      Locked (TVL) with $3.4 billion compared to Nova's less than $5 million.
      Notable DeFi protocols on Arbitrum One include Uniswap, Balancer, Aave,
      Sushi, and Curve. Nova, on the other hand, features Sushi and other
      lesser-known dApps like Arbswap, RCPswap, Symbiosis Finance, and Archly
      Finance.
