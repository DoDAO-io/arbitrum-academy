      ## What is Arbitrum Nova?

      Arbitrum Nova is a variant within the Arbitrum ecosystem that provides a
      high-performance blockchain solution. Arbitrum Nova operates on the
      AnyTrust protocol, which is mostly trustless but introduces a new element
      of trust. The core of this additional trust assumption is the Data
      Availability Committee (DAC), which has the task of efficiently handling
      Layer 2 transaction data—storing it, batching it, and then posting it to
      Ethereum's Layer 1. The presence of the DAC in the AnyTrust protocol is
      what allows Arbitrum Nova to offer enhanced performance and
      cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for use cases where these
      attributes are prioritized. 


      ## What is Anytrust Protocol 

      The AnyTrust protocol is a variation of the Arbitrum Nitro technology
      designed to reduce costs by incorporating a slight trust assumption.
      Instead of requiring every node within the Arbitrum network to have access
      to all Layer 2 transaction data—typically ensured by posting this data on
      Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust delegates this responsibility to a Data
      Availability Committee. This committee, comprising multiple members,
      operates under the assumption that at least two members are honest.
      Consequently, even if the majority collude, the integrity of data
      availability is maintained, allowing the rollup protocol to function
      correctly and reducing the reliance on Ethereum's more costly data posting
      process.


      ### Benefits of AnyTrust

      The benefits of AnyTrust are extensive including:


      #### Cost Reduction 

      The protocol diminishes the burden on the Ethereum mainnet by limiting the
      amount of data posted as calldata, which is the main cost driver in the
      Arbitrum system. By relying on a Committee to store and furnish data as
      needed, with protocols in place to manage membership and ensure data
      integrity through a system of public keys and signature requirements
      (Keysets), AnyTrust significantly reduces the gas costs associated with
      data availability. 


      #### Operational Efficiency 

      The structured management of Keysets, overseen by the L1 KeysetManager
      contract, adds flexibility and security to the Committee's operation,
      allowing for smooth membership changes and key updates while ensuring that
      the data is accessible to anyone with the Keyset hash. This setup fosters
      a trust-minimized environment that balances efficiency with the
      decentralized ethos of blockchain systems.

      ## What is AnyTrust?


      AnyTrust is a variant of the Arbitrum Nitro technology that aims to lower
      costs and improve efficiency by accepting a mild trust assumption. It
      operates by relying on an external Data Availability Committee (DAC) to
      store data and provide it when needed. The DAC consists of N members, with
      the assumption that at least two of them are honest.


      #### The Role of the Data Availability Committee


      The Data Availability Committee plays a crucial role in the AnyTrust
      protocol. It stores the data and ensures its availability for the rollup
      protocol to function correctly. If N-1 Committee members promise to
      provide access to certain data, it guarantees that at least one of the
      promising parties is honest, ensuring the availability of the data.


      #### Keysets and Membership Changes


      To facilitate membership changes and provide flexibility to Committee
      members, AnyTrust utilizes Keysets. A Keyset specifies the public keys of
      Committee members and the number of signatures required for a Data
      Availability Certificate to be valid. The L1 KeysetManager contract
      maintains a list of currently valid Keysets, allowing the contents to be
      recovered later by anyone given only the Keyset hash.


      ## Purpose of AnyTrust


      #### Lowering Costs and Improving Efficiency


      The main goal of AnyTrust is to reduce costs and speed up non-fungible
      withdrawals in the common case. By keeping the data off-chain in the
      happy/common case, the system can charge users significantly lower fees.
      This is achieved by leveraging the trust assumption and relying on the
      Committee to store and provide data on demand.

      ## What is a Data Availability Certificate (DACerts)

      ### Sequencer Committe Interaction

      ### Create Diagram 






      Data Availability Certificates (DACerts) are an essential component of
      AnyTrust, a system that ensures the availability of data in a
      decentralized network. A DACert serves as proof that a specific block's
      data will be accessible from at least one honest Committee member until a
      specified expiration time. It consists of a BLS aggregated signature,
      which demonstrates that N-1 Committee members have signed the (hash,
      expiration time) pair. By utilizing DACerts, AnyTrust enhances the
      trustworthiness and availability of data in the decentralized network. It
      provides a mechanism to ensure that data blocks can be accessed by at
      least one honest Committee member, thereby increasing the reliability of
      the system. DACerts offer a valuable solution for maintaining data
      availability and integrity in decentralized environments.


      #### How is it different from Nitro System? 


      In the traditional Nitro system, data blocks are posted on the L1 chain as
      calldata, and their hashes are committed by the L1 Inbox contract. This
      allows the data to be reliably read by L2 code. However, AnyTrust
      introduces an additional option for the sequencer to post a data block on
      L1: using a DACert to prove the availability of the data.


      #### Verification of DACert


      When a DACert is submitted to the L1 inbox contract, it undergoes
      validation checks. The contract ensures that the DACert uses a valid
      Keyset, while other aspects of DACert validity are verified by the L2
      code. These checks include confirming that the number of signers meets the
      requirements of the Keyset and that the expiration time is at least two
      weeks after the current L2 timestamp. If a DACert is found to be invalid
      during the validation process, the L2 code discards it and proceeds to the
      next data block. However, if the DACert is valid, the L2 code reads the
      associated data block, which is guaranteed to be available due to the
      DACert's validity.

      ## Differences between Arbitrum Nova (AnyTrust) and Arbitrum One (Rollup)


      | Feature               | Arbitrum One
      (Rollup)                                                        | Arbitrum
      Nova (AnyTrust)                                               |

      |-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

      | **Data Authenticity** | Layer 2 transaction data is posted on the
      Ethereum blockchain.               | Uses AnyTrust technology with a Data
      Availability Committee (DAC).     |

      | **Trust Assumption**  | Trustless and permissionless, open for anyone to
      validate.                   | Relies on at least two honest DAC members to
      operate securely.         |

      | **Gas Price**         | Minimum gas price is 0.1
      gwei.                                               | Minimum gas price is
      0.01 gwei, potentially 10x cheaper.               |

      | **Scalability**       | Suitable for general use
      cases.                                              | More scalable,
      designed for high-load dApps like NFTs and social networks. |

      | **DeFi Protocols**    | Higher TVL with major DeFi protocols like
      Uniswap, Aave, and Curve.          | Lower TVL with a focus on gaming and
      social, includes Sushi and others.   |

      | **Transaction Costs** | Relatively higher due to full data posting on
      Ethereum.                      | Lower costs due to only posting
      certificates on Layer 1.               |
