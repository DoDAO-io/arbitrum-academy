      ## Arbitrum Nova?


      Arbitrum Nova is a high-performance alternative to Arbitrum One's chain.
      While Arbitrum One focuses on pure trustlessness through the Rollup
      protocol, Arbitrum Nova implements the AnyTrust protocol, which introduces
      an additional trust assumption in the form of a Data Availability
      Committee (DAC). This committee is responsible for storing, batching, and
      posting L2 transaction data to Ethereum's L1, expediting the process and
      improving performance and affordability. AnyTrust manages data off-chain,
      relying on the committee members to provide the necessary data in case of
      a challenge. This off-chain approach allows AnyTrust to offer lower fees,
      making it a sensible tradeoff for applications that require high
      transaction throughput but don't need the full decentralization provided
      by rollups.


      #### Use Cases and Focus


      Arbitrum Nova is tailored for building social applications and gaming. The
      new chain aims to help creators tackle scalability, privacy, and
      speed-related issues. By implementing optimistic rollup technology,
      Arbitrum Nova offers faster transactions, lower fees, and robust
      Ethereum-based security benefits for Web3 developers. It provides full
      access to the EVM environment, allowing developers to test out the new
      technology and explore a broader range of use cases.


      #### Transaction Data Handling


      Arbitrum Nova utilizes the AnyTrust technology introduced in early 2022,
      which significantly reduces transaction costs by only putting data
      on-chain if the committee fails to perform its function. This approach
      makes it ideal for projects with high transaction volume expectations,
      such as gaming and social platforms. The creators of Arbitrum Nova also
      plan to implement further improvements to reduce transaction costs over
      time, ensuring that the chain remains efficient and cost-effective for
      developers.

      ## What is AnyTrust?


      AnyTrust is a variant of the Arbitrum Nitro technology that aims to lower
      costs and improve efficiency by accepting a mild trust assumption. It
      operates by relying on an external Data Availability Committee (DAC) to
      store data and provide it when needed. The DAC consists of N members, with
      the assumption that at least two of them are honest.


      #### The Role of the Data Availability Committee


      The Data Availability Committee plays a crucial role in the AnyTrust
      protocol. It stores the data and ensures its availability for the rollup
      protocol to function correctly. If N-1 Committee members promise to
      provide access to certain data, it guarantees that at least one of the
      promising parties is honest, ensuring the availability of the data.


      #### Keysets and Membership Changes


      To facilitate membership changes and provide flexibility to Committee
      members, AnyTrust utilizes Keysets. A Keyset specifies the public keys of
      Committee members and the number of signatures required for a Data
      Availability Certificate to be valid. The L1 KeysetManager contract
      maintains a list of currently valid Keysets, allowing the contents to be
      recovered later by anyone given only the Keyset hash.


      ## Purpose of AnyTrust


      #### Lowering Costs and Improving Efficiency


      The main goal of AnyTrust is to reduce costs and speed up non-fungible
      withdrawals in the common case. By keeping the data off-chain in the
      happy/common case, the system can charge users significantly lower fees.
      This is achieved by leveraging the trust assumption and relying on the
      Committee to store and provide data on demand.

      ## What is a Data Availability Certificate (DACerts)

      ### Sequencer Committe Interaction

      ### Create Diagram 






      Data Availability Certificates (DACerts) are an essential component of
      AnyTrust, a system that ensures the availability of data in a
      decentralized network. A DACert serves as proof that a specific block's
      data will be accessible from at least one honest Committee member until a
      specified expiration time. It consists of a BLS aggregated signature,
      which demonstrates that N-1 Committee members have signed the (hash,
      expiration time) pair. By utilizing DACerts, AnyTrust enhances the
      trustworthiness and availability of data in the decentralized network. It
      provides a mechanism to ensure that data blocks can be accessed by at
      least one honest Committee member, thereby increasing the reliability of
      the system. DACerts offer a valuable solution for maintaining data
      availability and integrity in decentralized environments.


      #### How is it different from Nitro System? 


      In the traditional Nitro system, data blocks are posted on the L1 chain as
      calldata, and their hashes are committed by the L1 Inbox contract. This
      allows the data to be reliably read by L2 code. However, AnyTrust
      introduces an additional option for the sequencer to post a data block on
      L1: using a DACert to prove the availability of the data.


      #### Verification of DACert


      When a DACert is submitted to the L1 inbox contract, it undergoes
      validation checks. The contract ensures that the DACert uses a valid
      Keyset, while other aspects of DACert validity are verified by the L2
      code. These checks include confirming that the number of signers meets the
      requirements of the Keyset and that the expiration time is at least two
      weeks after the current L2 timestamp. If a DACert is found to be invalid
      during the validation process, the L2 code discards it and proceeds to the
      next data block. However, if the DACert is valid, the L2 code reads the
      associated data block, which is guaranteed to be available due to the
      DACert's validity.

      ## Differences between Arbitrum Nova (AnyTrust) and Arbitrum One (Rollup)


      | Feature               | Arbitrum One
      (Rollup)                                                        | Arbitrum
      Nova (AnyTrust)                                               |

      |-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

      | **Data Authenticity** | Layer 2 transaction data is posted on the
      Ethereum blockchain.               | Uses AnyTrust technology with a Data
      Availability Committee (DAC).     |

      | **Trust Assumption**  | Trustless and permissionless, open for anyone to
      validate.                   | Relies on at least two honest DAC members to
      operate securely.         |

      | **Gas Price**         | Minimum gas price is 0.1
      gwei.                                               | Minimum gas price is
      0.01 gwei, potentially 10x cheaper.               |

      | **Scalability**       | Suitable for general use
      cases.                                              | More scalable,
      designed for high-load dApps like NFTs and social networks. |

      | **DeFi Protocols**    | Higher TVL with major DeFi protocols like
      Uniswap, Aave, and Curve.          | Lower TVL with a focus on gaming and
      social, includes Sushi and others.   |

      | **Transaction Costs** | Relatively higher due to full data posting on
      Ethereum.                      | Lower costs due to only posting
      certificates on Layer 1.               |
