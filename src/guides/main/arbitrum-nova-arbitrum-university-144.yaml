      ## Arbitrum Nova?


      Arbitrum Nova is a high-performance alternative to Arbitrum One's chain.
      While Arbitrum One focuses on pure trustlessness through the Rollup
      protocol, Arbitrum Nova implements the AnyTrust protocol, which introduces
      an additional trust assumption in the form of a Data Availability
      Committee (DAC). This committee is responsible for storing, batching, and
      posting L2 transaction data to Ethereum's L1, expediting the process and
      improving performance and affordability. AnyTrust manages data off-chain,
      relying on the committee members to provide the necessary data in case of
      a challenge. This off-chain approach allows AnyTrust to offer lower fees,
      making it a sensible tradeoff for applications that require high
      transaction throughput but don't need the full decentralization provided
      by rollups.


      #### Use Cases and Focus


      Arbitrum Nova is tailored for building social applications and gaming. The
      new chain aims to help creators tackle scalability, privacy, and
      speed-related issues. By implementing optimistic rollup technology,
      Arbitrum Nova offers faster transactions, lower fees, and robust
      Ethereum-based security benefits for Web3 developers. It provides full
      access to the EVM environment, allowing developers to test out the new
      technology and explore a broader range of use cases.


      #### Transaction Data Handling


      Arbitrum Nova utilizes the AnyTrust technology introduced in early 2022,
      which significantly reduces transaction costs by only putting data
      on-chain if the committee fails to perform its function. This approach
      makes it ideal for projects with high transaction volume expectations,
      such as gaming and social platforms. The creators of Arbitrum Nova also
      plan to implement further improvements to reduce transaction costs over
      time, ensuring that the chain remains efficient and cost-effective for
      developers.

      ## What is AnyTrust?


      AnyTrust is a variant of the Arbitrum Nitro technology that aims to lower
      costs and improve efficiency by accepting a mild trust assumption. It
      operates by relying on an external Data Availability Committee (DAC) to
      store data and provide it when needed. The DAC consists of N members, with
      the assumption that at least two of them are honest.


      #### The Role of the Data Availability Committee


      The Data Availability Committee plays a crucial role in the AnyTrust
      protocol. It stores the data and ensures its availability for the rollup
      protocol to function correctly. If N-1 Committee members promise to
      provide access to certain data, it guarantees that at least one of the
      promising parties is honest, ensuring the availability of the data.


      #### Keysets and Membership Changes


      To facilitate membership changes and provide flexibility to Committee
      members, AnyTrust utilizes Keysets. A Keyset specifies the public keys of
      Committee members and the number of signatures required for a Data
      Availability Certificate to be valid. The L1 KeysetManager contract
      maintains a list of currently valid Keysets, allowing the contents to be
      recovered later by anyone given only the Keyset hash.


      ## Benefits of Nova


      #### Lowering Costs and Improving Efficiency


      The main goal of AnyTrust is to reduce costs and speed up non-fungible
      withdrawals in the common case. By keeping the data off-chain in the
      happy/common case, the system can charge users significantly lower fees.
      This is achieved by leveraging the trust assumption and relying on the
      Committee to store and provide data on demand.
