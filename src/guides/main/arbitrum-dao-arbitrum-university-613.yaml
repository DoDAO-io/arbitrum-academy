      ## What is Arbitrum DAO 

      The Arbitrum DAO is a collective that governs the Arbitrum ecosystem,
      which operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It represents the
      interests of $ARB token holders, enabling them to shape the ecosystem by
      proposing and voting on Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Governance
      is executed via smart contracts on the Arbitrum One rollup, a Layer 2
      solution enhancing Ethereum's scalability. It is a pivotal structure that
      empowers decentralized decision-making and the stewardship of the Arbitrum
      network's future, reflecting the collective will of its participants.

      </div>


      The DAO's treasury, also managed through smart contracts, funds the
      development and maintenance of the platform. Moreover, the DAO oversees a
      Security Council, elected biannually by the members, to address urgent
      security matters swiftly, ensuring the ecosystem's safety and reliability.


      ## Why is it important?

      The transition to decentralized governance of Arbitrum's technology is a
      crucial advancement towards empowering the community to oversee the
      scaling solutions of Ethereum. This development harmonizes the objectives
      of the Arbitrum community with the broader Ethereum community. It is
      important due to the following reasons:


      1. Ensuring that decision-making processes are democratic and reflect the
      collective will, rather than being reliant on a select few.


      2. Holding $ARB tokens signifies a vested interest in the decentralized
      progression of both Arbitrum and Ethereum. Token holders are afforded the
      opportunity to collaboratively guide the expansion and scaling of
      Ethereum's ecosystem.


      3. Being an $ARB token holder places you at the forefront of innovative
      governance models with significant implications for society. It ensures
      that your perspective is valued and permanently recorded.


      ## What is $ARB?

      The $ARB token is a digital asset based on the ERC-20 standard, which
      grants holders the right to participate in the governance of the Arbitrum
      ecosystem through the Arbitrum DAO. This token is created on the Arbitrum
      One rollup chain, which operates as a Layer 2 solution enhancing
      Ethereum's capabilities. $ARB token holders play an integral part to
      oversee the management of the governance protocols and the technological
      infrastructure of the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains. Token holders
      use their $ARB to vote on proposals that dictate the networks' upgrades
      and the allocation of the DAO's funds.

      </div>


      Voting power in the Arbitrum DAO is proportional to the amount of $ARB
      tokens one holds or controls through delegation. This means that votes are
      weighted based on the number of tokens, with more tokens translating to a
      greater influence on the outcome of proposals. $ARB tokens can also be
      delegated, allowing token holders to entrust their voting power to others,
      which is particularly useful for members who may not be actively involved
      in the day-to-day governance activities. These minting events are also
      subject to governance through the DAO's proposal system.


      ### $ARB vs $Eth

      It is important to understand the similarities and differences between the
      two tokens. 


      **Similarities**

      1. Both are powered by decentralized blockchain technology.

      2. Both can be owned by any cryptocurrency wallet that supports $ETH.

      3. Both can be bought, sold, and traded.


      **Differences**

      1. $ETH is a transactional token, while $ARB is a governance token.

      2. $ETH is used to pay for transaction fees, while $ARB is not.

      3. Governance of Arbitrum is facilitated by $ARB and governance smart
      contracts, while Ethereum's governance is handled socially.

      4. Holding $ARB gives you the ability to govern Arbitrum, while holding
      $ETH doesn't impact your ability to govern Ethereum's protocol.

      ## Governance Structure

      The governance framework of the Arbitrum Rollup protocol is structured
      around the Arbitrum DAO and the Security Council:


      ### Security Council

      The Security Council consists of twelve members who are chosen through an
      election process by the Arbitrum DAO. This group's primary responsibility
      is to maintain the security and performance of Arbitrum, which includes
      the authority to take urgent measures in extraordinary situations to
      protect the network.


      ### Arbitrum DAO

      On the other hand, the Arbitrum DAO represents the collective of $ARB
      token holders across the globe, along with their appointed delegates. It
      holds the overarching governance responsibilities for the Arbitrum
      ecosystem, including the election and oversight of the Security Council.
      The DAO has the power to shape the council's role through constitutional
      proposals, which can redefine or revoke the council's authority if deemed
      necessary for the community's interest.


      ## Decision Making by Arbitrum Governance

      The Arbitrum governance system holds the crucial role of deciding on
      upgrades to the core contracts of Arbitrum chains that govern the
      network's protocols. These upgrades can be driven by various motivations
      such as performance enhancements, security fixes, or broader ecosystem
      improvements.

      1. An upgrade could improve the system in some way, like increase its
      decentralization or optimize its performance and lower fees.

      2. An upgrade could fix a critical vulnerability.

      3. An upgrade could address a non-critical decision that affects the
      Arbitrum ecosystem at large.

      4. The Arbitrum DAO is also responsible for authorization of the creation
      of new L2 chains

      ## Web3 Layers

      Imagine Arbitrum's stakeholders as a hierarchy of support layers, with the
      web3 user layer at the top:


      1. **Web3 User Layer**: This is where users interact with decentralized
      applications (dApps).

      2. **Web3 App Layer**: Here, you have the innovators and developers
      creating the dApps and tools needed for the web3 ecosystem.

      3. **Layer 2 (L2)**: This layer is made up of the Arbitrum DAO, its
      community, node operators, sequencers, and companies like Offchain Labs,
      all working to advance Ethereum's rollup-based future.

      4. **Layer 1 (L1)**: Encompasses the base layers of Ethereum's blockchain.

      5. **Consensus Layer (CL)**: Teams like Prysm contribute here, maintaining
      the agreement protocol of Ethereum's beacon chain.

      6. **Execution Layer (EL)**: Involves groups like Geth who develop the
      software that executes blockchain transactions.

      7. **Research Layer**: This includes experts focused on the latest
      developments in cryptography, economic system design, and governance
      models.


      ## Participation Options

      The users can choose to participate in the protocol's decisons using one
      of the many participation options such as:

      1. **Choose a Representative**: If you don't have time to vote on Arbitrum
      DAO proposals, you can appoint someone to vote for you. For how to do
      this, refer to "Delegate your voting power."

      2. **Vote Yourself**: If you prefer to have a direct say, you can vote on
      DAO proposals on your own. For the process, see "Vote on proposals."

      3. **Represent Others**: If you're keen on representing the community, you
      can become someone who votes for others. To learn more, check out "Become
      a delegate."

      4. **Engage in Discussions**: Take part in shaping the future by joining
      the conversations on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum.

      5. **Connect on Discord**: Join the "Arbinauts" on Discord to be part of
      the community.
