      ## Voting in Arbitrum DAO

      Voting in the Arbitrum DAO represents a critical function in the
      decentralized decision-making process. It is the means by which $ARB
      governance token holders can have their say in the direction of the DAO's
      actions, from proposing amendments to the DAO's Constitution to deciding
      on the allocation of funds for various projects. This democratic approach
      is fundamental to the decentralized ethos that underpins the Arbitrum
      ecosystem, ensuring that all decisions reflect the collective will of the
      community rather than the desires of a centralized authority.

      ## Importance of Voting

      The necessity of voting lies in several key areas:


      1. **Decentralization**: Voting is the cornerstone of decentralized
      governance. By enabling token holders to vote on proposals, the DAO
      ensures that the power dynamics remain balanced and distributed across its
      member base, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few.


      2. **Consensus Building**: The voting process facilitates a fair and
      transparent method for reaching consensus on important issues. It allows
      for diverse opinions to be heard and considered, ultimately leading to
      decisions that are in the best interest of the entire DAO and its
      underlying technologies.

      </div>


      3. **Responsiveness**: Voting ensures that the DAO can respond swiftly to
      new developments and challenges. As the needs and priorities of the DAO
      evolve, voting allows for the agile adaptation of strategies and the
      implementation of new initiatives.


      4. **Engagement and Ownership**: By participating in votes, members are
      actively engaging with the DAO's governance. This not only fosters a sense
      of community but also gives members a sense of ownership over the DAO's
      future, as they are directly involved in shaping it.

      The voting power of an individual is proportional to the number of $ARB
      tokens they possess. When casting votes, members are encouraged to assess
      proposals based on these values, ensuring that decisions align with the
      DAO's overarching goals. In the Arbitrum DAO, the voting process is
      designed to facilitate community-driven governance through four distinct
      types of votes:


      ### Temperature Check

      A temperature check is an initial voting step within the Arbitrum DAO
      designed to measure community interest in a proposed idea or action before
      it advances through the governance process. This preliminary assessment is
      conducted on the Snapshot platform, a decentralized voting interface. To
      participate in a temperature check, $ARB token holders must possess or
      represent at least 0.01% of the total votable tokens. The purpose of this
      step is to ensure that the community sufficiently supports a proposal
      before dedicating more resources to further discussion and voting. It acts
      as a community pulse-taking measure, enabling the DAO to filter out
      proposals that lack substantial backing, thus streamlining the governance
      process to focus on initiatives with broader interest.

      </div>


      ### On-chain Vote

      An on-chain vote in the Arbitrum DAO occurs after a proposal passes the
      preliminary temperature check. This vote is conducted on the blockchain
      via Tally, a governance platform, and can only be initiated by $ARB token
      holders with at least 1,000,000 votable tokens. For a proposal to pass, it
      must receive affirmative votes from more than 50% of the voting
      participants. Additionally, constitutional changes require support from at
      least 5% of all tokens, while non-constitutional changes need 3%. These
      specifics ensure that only proposals with substantial community backing
      are ratified, reflecting the DAO's commitment to a democratic and
      transparent decision-making process.

      Active participation in the Arbitrum DAO means voting on member-submitted
      governance proposals. Following it is briefed how to navigate the voting
      process across different proposal stages:


      ## How to vote for proposals in the "temperature check" stage

      Here's how to participate in the temperature check stage for proposals in
      the Arbitrum DAO:


      ### Step 1: Review Proposals

      Access the Arbitrum DAO governance forum online. Find and select the
      proposal you are interested in. Read the proposal details and the
      community discussion thread thoroughly. Provide your feedback and engage
      with other community members in the discussion to refine the proposal.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701358842819_temperature_check.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Step 2: Vote on Snapshot

      Follow the link to the associated Snapshot poll provided in the forum
      submission. On Snapshot, connect your Ethereum wallet that holds your $ARB
      tokens. Navigate to the Arbitrum DAO space on Snapshot and locate the
      specific proposal.


      ### Step 3: Cast Your Vote

      Proceed to vote on the proposal by following Snapshot's user interface
      prompts. Remember, your participation as an $ARB token holder or delegate
      is vital for the temperature check, as it helps determine whether the
      proposal has enough community interest to proceed to the next stages of
      the voting process.


      ## How to vote for proposals in the "on-chain vote" stage

      Here is how to vote on proposals in the on-chain vote stage using Tally
      for the Arbitrum DAO:


      ### Step 1: Navigate to DAOs

      Visit the Tally website and log in using the wallet to which $ARB tokens
      have been delegated. Make sure the delegation was done before the start of
      the voting period. Once logged in, either go to the "explore DAOs" section
      to find the Arbitrum DAO or click on "My DAOs" if you have already
      interacted with the Arbitrum DAO on Tally.


      ### Step 2: Find the Proposal

      Choose between Constitutional or non-Constitutional AIPs (Arbitrum
      Improvement Proposals) on the Arbitrum DAO's page. Within the selected
      category, look for the proposal you wish to vote on.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1701358883417_on_chain%20voting.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Step 3: Vote

      Click on the proposal to view the details, and then cast your vote in
      accordance with your stance on the proposal. Ensure your vote counts by
      participating within the specified voting period. For a proposal to pass
      the on-chain vote stage:

      - It must garner more affirmative votes than negative ones.

      - Constitutional AIPs require at least 5% of all votable tokens to vote in
      favor, while non-Constitutional AIPs need at least 3% of votable tokens to
      be cast in favor for approval.

      ## How to Delegate Voting Power?

      Delegating your voting power within the Arbitrum DAO allows you to have a
      say in its governance, even if you're unable to participate directly. Here
      are the step to delegating your voting power:


      ### Step 1: Assess Potential Delegates

      Consider the delegate's alignment with the DAO's values, their track
      record, community engagement, responsiveness, and technical expertise.
      Then go to the Arbitrum DAO delegation page on Tally, the platform used by
      Arbitrum DAO for governance. Click on "Connect Wallet" on Tally and choose
      the wallet address that holds your $ARB tokens (e.g., MetaMask).


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/voting_on_dao_proposals_arbitrum_university_711/1700068848597_screenshot_2023-11-15%20at%2010.18.30%20pm.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Step 2: Choose a Delegate

      Select the "Delegate" tab in the top menu on the Arbitrum DAO page on
      Tally. Use the search bar to find a delegate by their Ethereum address or
      name. Click on the "Delegate" button next to your chosen delegate's name.

      </div>


      ### Step 3: Confirm the Transaction

      A pop-up window will appear for confirmation. Click on the "Delegate"
      button there and confirm the transaction on your wallet. Wait for the
      Arbitrum One network to confirm the transaction. Check the "Votes" tab on
      Tally to ensure your delegation to the chosen delegate is listed.
