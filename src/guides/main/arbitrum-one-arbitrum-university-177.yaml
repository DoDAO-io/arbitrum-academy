      ## Arbitrum One?


      Arbitrum One is a Layer 2 (L2) optimistic rollup chain that aims to
      improve the performance and user experience of Ethereum. It is built on
      the Arbitrum Rollup protocol and settles transactions on Ethereum's Layer
      1 (L1) chain. The goal of Arbitrum One is to enable the development of
      high-performance Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) with low
      transaction costs and Ethereum-grade security guarantees, all without
      introducing additional trust assumptions.


      #### Features of Arbitrum One


      Arbitrum One utilizes the Nitro technology stack, which is based on a
      "Geth-at-the-core" architecture. This technology stack provides advanced
      calldata compression, separate contexts for common execution and fault
      proving, Ethereum L1 gas compatibility, and more. By leveraging these
      features, Arbitrum One is able to overcome the limitations of transaction
      throughput on the Ethereum Mainnet (L1) and offer a scalable solution for
      handling transactions off L1.


      #### Dispute Resolution


      Arbitrum One employs a multi-round interactive design to efficiently
      resolve disputes on L1 at a low cost. When a validator on L2 posts bundled
      data to L1, they lock a bond in a smart contract. If someone believes the
      transaction data is incorrect, they can issue a challenge within a
      specified time window and also lock a bond in the smart contract. The
      validator and the challenger then work together to split the disputed part
      in a dichotomous way off-chain until the dispute is narrowed down to a
      specific part. Finally, they go to L1 to resolve the dispute.
