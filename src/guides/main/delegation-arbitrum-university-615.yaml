      ## What is a Delegate?

      A delegate within the Arbitrum DAO plays a vital role in the governance
      process, acting as a proxy for token holders who may not have the time or
      inclination to participate in the frequent and often complex
      decision-making processes. These delegates are entrusted by token holders
      who willingly transfer their voting rights, empowering the delegate to act
      on their behalf in the governance of the Arbitrum ecosystem. To become a
      delegate, one must be elected by the community of $ARB token holders, a
      process that reflects the trust and expectations of the electorate. Once
      in position, delegates are not only expected to vote on proposals but also
      to engage actively in discussions, represent the interests of their
      constituents, and contribute to the strategic direction of Arbitrum.


      The role of a delegate is bound by the Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO,
      which outlines the ethical and procedural guidelines to ensure that their
      actions are transparent and aligned with the collective will of the token
      holders they represent. The Constitution ensures that the governance of
      Arbitrum remains fair, systematic, and consistent with the community's
      values. Token holders who delegate their votes maintain the right to
      oversee their delegate's decisions and can withdraw their delegation at
      any point. This mechanism ensures that delegates remain accountable to
      their constituents, who can reclaim their direct voting power to influence
      specific proposals that they feel strongly about.
