      ## What is Governance?

      Governance is the process by which decisions are made within an
      organization. In traditional web2 setups, corporations make decisions
      through a board of directors, a small group chosen by the company's
      shareholders. When decisions are needed, the board discusses and votes,
      though their processes may not always be transparent to the shareholders.
      Web3 technologies, like those in the Arbitrum ecosystem, start similarly
      but move towards a system where decision-making is spread out among its
      community. This shift is known as progressive decentralization. Through
      these mechanisms, web3 governance aims to distribute power among its
      stakeholders, moving away from the centralized model of traditional
      corporate governance.


      ## Progressive Decentralization 

      Progressive decentralization is a process where control of a project
      shifts from a small, central group to its wider community. It involves
      setting up a DAO and issuing governance tokens, empowering community
      members to make decisions and guide the project's future democratically.
      This shift involves:

      </div>


      **1. DAO Formation:** Entities like the Arbitrum DAO are created, taking
      over the governance of the network. The DAO operates based on a set of
      rules outlined in the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, which acts as a blueprint
      for its operations.


      **2. Governance Tokens:** Ownership of governance tokens indicates
      membership in the DAO. Token holders, such as those holding $ARB, are
      eligible to vote on proposals affecting the network's future.


      **3. Smart Contracts:** DAO governance relies on transparent smart
      contracts instead of traditional legal contracts. These smart contracts
      execute the rules set out in the DAO Constitution and allow for trustless,
      decentralized decision-making.


      ## Components of Progressive Decentralisation

      The level of decentralization for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is
      established by the following elements:


      ### Chain ownership

      Chain ownership refers to who has the power to make changes to a
      blockchain's protocol, like updating its core smart contracts, tweaking
      system settings, or even stopping the system temporarily. Chain ownership
      for Arbitrum One and Nova is managed by the Arbitrum DAO, where $ARB token
      holders and their delegates vote on protocol changes, and a Security
      Council that can intervene in emergencies. This dual governance structure
      safeguards the network, but there are risks if the Council or DAO acts
      maliciously. Despite this, users have a safety net to withdraw funds to
      Ethereum if needed. The governance framework also has the flexibility to
      evolve itself through its own voting processes.


      ### Validator ownership

      Validator ownership pertains to the entities that verify the correct
      functioning of the Arbitrum chains and confirm this on the Ethereum
      mainnet (L1). Presently, only a select group of public entities are
      authorized to validate on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, as part of a
      controlled allow-list you can review. The governance system holds the
      authority to modify this list of validators. The risk here is if all the
      active validators are dishonest and one of them updates the chain with
      incorrect information, it could endanger the security of the system.
      However, the Arbitrum governance has the capability to change who is on
      the allow-list, which includes the power to add new validators, remove
      existing ones, or eliminate the allow-list altogether, thereby potentially
      opening up the validation process.

      </div>


      ### Sequencer ownership

      Validator ownership in the context of Arbitrum involves the role of the
      Sequencer, which is tasked with gathering and sequencing users'
      transactions. Right now, this function is centralized, with the Sequencers
      for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova operated by the Arbitrum
      Foundation. The governance system has the authority to appoint new
      Sequencers as needed. The main risk with a centralized Sequencer is that
      it can temporarily delay or reorder user transactions up to 24 hours,
      although it cannot threaten the overall security of the system or
      permanently prevent a transaction from being processed. The current
      structure allows for changes: the Arbitrum governance has the ability to
      replace the Sequencer if the community decides it is necessary through its
      voting mechanisms.


      ### Data Availability Committee (DAC) ownership

      The Data Availability Committee (DAC) is essential for Arbitrum Nova,
      which is an "AnyTrust" chain that depends on a selected group to store and
      provide its data when needed. Presently, a 7-member committee handles this
      task for the Arbitrum Nova chain. The members of this committee are
      publicly listed and can be updated by the governance system, which has the
      power to add or remove members. There's a risk involved; if 6 out of the 7
      members, along with the Sequencer, act against the network's interests,
      they could threaten the safety of the system. However, the governance
      structure of Arbitrum is set up to address such issues, holding the
      authority to make changes to the DAC. This includes the ability to change
      its membership or adjust its influence on the network, ensuring the
      committee aligns with the community's trust and the network's security
      needs.

      Decentralized governance distributes power among a broad community,
      ensuring that no single entity has unchecked control and that decisions
      reflect the collective will. This happens through the use of following
      principles:


      ## Chain Ownership 

      Arbitrum networks, such as Arbitrum One, employ the role of a "chain
      owner," who functions as the system administrator, overseeing updates and
      modifications. This role isn't defined by the Arbitrum protocol itself but
      is crucial for maintaining and enhancing the system. The chain owner has
      the authority to adjust key parameters, halt transaction processing, and
      crucially, upgrade the contracts that underpin the protocol.


      Upgrades to an Arbitrum chain's core contracts are essential for various
      reasons. They enable the implementation of planned enhancements and they
      will continue to be necessary for future, unforeseen technological
      developments. Moreover, they are critical for addressing any serious flaws
      discovered in the code and for adapting to major updates on Ethereum.
      Given the substantial impact these changes can have, the role of chain
      ownership is significant and must be considered with the utmost
      seriousness within Arbitrum's journey towards greater decentralization.


      ## On-Chain Governance 

      Layer 2 (L2) on-chain governance is essential due to the inherent
      differences in how Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 protocols operate. Unlike
      Ethereum, which is an L1 protocol where changes are made through a broad
      social consensus—essentially, node operators choose to update their
      software and the majority version becomes the 'real' Ethereum—L2 protocols
      like Arbitrum are directly governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum
      blockchain. For Arbitrum to implement upgrades, it's not enough to merely
      update the node software; the underlying Ethereum smart contracts, which
      are not governed by the social consensus of the Arbitrum community but by
      Ethereum, must also be updated. This means that while Ethereum can evolve
      through an informal, community-driven process, Arbitrum requires a formal
      governance structure to authorize and enact changes.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:700px;margin-bottom:60px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_governance_arbitrum_university_791/1701278771993_balancing_powers.png"/>
      </div>


      Theoretically, it's possible for Ethereum to adjust its consensus rules to
      allow L2 upgrades, a concept referred to as "enshrined rollups." However,
      this is not a near-future prospect and would require extensive
      deliberation within the Ethereum community, which is beyond the Arbitrum
      community's control. Thus, the necessity for L2 on-chain governance
      emerges as the practical solution for now, providing a structured pathway
      for upgrades and ensuring that the power to modify the protocol doesn't
      reside with a centralized owner but is distributed across the community.
      This governance ensures decisions are transparent, verifiable, and aligned
      with the collective interest of the network's stakeholders.


      ## Decentralization using $ARB

      The $ARB governance token facilitates decentralized decision-making within
      the Arbitrum ecosystem. By distributing these tokens broadly, often
      through a process called an airdrop, ownership and governance powers are
      shared across a diverse group of stakeholders worldwide, forming what's
      known as the Arbitrum DAO. This group of token holders, and those they
      designate to vote on their behalf, has the collective authority to
      propose, discuss, vote on, and implement changes to the protocol.


      In this decentralized governance model, no single party has overarching
      control. The process is designed to be inclusive and transparent, with the
      DAO having the autonomy to manage the protocol's evolution. Smart
      contracts ensure that the process is followed, allowing time for careful
      consideration and voting on proposals. If a change is approved, there is a
      safeguard in place: users have the opportunity to exit the system with
      their assets if they disagree with the new direction. This system ensures
      that power is balanced and the community has a say in the future of
      Arbitrum.

      ## Features of Security Counsil

      The Security Council's dual capacity for immediate action in emergencies
      and methodical upgrades in non-critical situations ensures the network's
      stability and responsiveness to threats, all while remaining accountable
      to the Arbitrum DAO's governance structure.


      ### Emergency Protocol Upgrades


      The Security Council can swiftly implement protocol upgrades in
      emergencies, bypassing the standard governance process. Immediate action
      in case of critical vulnerabilities, without publicizing sensitive
      information in the DAO's governance forum. Empowered to act directly and
      expediently to apply urgent fixes, safeguarding the protocol's integrity.


      ### Governance and Oversight


      The Security Council is obliged to adhere to the Arbitrum DAO Constitution
      and to provide transparency reports post-action. Members are elected by
      the DAO through semi-annual elections, ensuring that the council acts in
      the network's best interests.


      ### Routine Upgrades


      Non-critical updates such as software maintenance and minor improvements.
      These upgrades are subject to a delay period, allowing users the choice to
      withdraw if they disagree with the changes.


      ### Resources


      Detailed information about the Security Council's operations and
      guidelines can be found in the Security Council concept doc. The formal
      responsibilities and limits of the Security Council are outlined in The
      Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO. 


      ## Way forward 

      The launch of Arbitrum's governance equips the community with two key
      mechanisms: a decentralized governance model and a swift, controlled
      upgrade path for emergency situations. Looking ahead, the community faces
      pivotal questions about the evolution of this system:


      - Is it possible to achieve even greater decentralization in the
      governance process?

      - What steps can be taken to reduce or even remove the Security Council's
      authority?


      Finding answers to these questions will require ongoing, robust
      discussions as Arbitrum develops and as perceptions of decentralization's
      risks and benefits evolve. Importantly, the Arbitrum governance system has
      full authority over the protocol's future, including the governance model
      itself. This means that the future shape of Arbitrum, including changes to
      how it is governed, rests with the Arbitrum community, ensuring that the
      network's trajectory aligns with the collective vision and values of its
      stakeholders.
