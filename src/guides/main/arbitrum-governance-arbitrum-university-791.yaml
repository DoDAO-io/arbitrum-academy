      ## What is Governance?

      Governance is the process by which decisions are made within an
      organization. In traditional web2 setups, corporations make decisions
      through a board of directors, a small group chosen by the company's
      shareholders. When decisions are needed, the board discusses and votes,
      though their processes may not always be transparent to the shareholders.
      Web3 technologies, like those in the Arbitrum ecosystem, start similarly
      but move towards a system where decision-making is spread out among its
      community. This shift is known as progressive decentralization. Through
      these mechanisms, web3 governance aims to distribute power among its
      stakeholders, moving away from the centralized model of traditional
      corporate governance.


      ## Progressive Decentralization 

      Progressive decentralization is a process where control of a project
      shifts from a small, central group to its wider community. It involves
      setting up a DAO and issuing governance tokens, empowering community
      members to make decisions and guide the project's future democratically.
      This shift involves:


      **1. DAO Formation: **Entities like the Arbitrum DAO are created, taking
      over the governance of the network. The DAO operates based on a set of
      rules outlined in the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, which acts as a blueprint
      for its operations.


      **2. Governance Tokens:** Ownership of governance tokens indicates
      membership in the DAO. Token holders, such as those holding $ARB, are
      eligible to vote on proposals affecting the network's future.


      **3. Smart Contracts:** DAO governance relies on transparent smart
      contracts instead of traditional legal contracts. These smart contracts
      execute the rules set out in the DAO Constitution and allow for trustless,
      decentralized decision-making.
