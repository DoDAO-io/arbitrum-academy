      ## What is a Blockchain Bridge?


      A blockchain bridge is a protocol that connects two separate blockchain
      networks, allowing for the exchange of tokens and information between
      them. It acts as a link or a bridge that enables cross-chain interactions,
      making the blockchain world more interconnected and collaborative.


      There are various types of blockchain bridges, but most popular ones
      support a wide range of assets and multiple blockchains. They typically
      charge a small fee for the transfer, usually ranging from 0.01% to 0.05%
      of the bridged amount. However, some bridges, especially official ones,
      have zero fees besides the gas costs.


      The process of transferring assets through a blockchain bridge usually
      involves a lock and mint <-> burn and unlock system. The bridge locks the
      assets on the source chain, then mints an equivalent number of wrapped
      assets on the destination chain. These wrapped assets can be burned to
      unlock the original assets on the source chain.


      ## Benefits of Blockchain Bridge


      #### Creating Interoperable Blockchain Ecosystem


      The main purpose of a blockchain bridge is to create an interoperable
      blockchain ecosystem, where different networks can communicate and work
      together. Before the introduction of bridges, each blockchain operated
      independently, and users had to maintain balances on each blockchain they
      wanted to interact with. This meant holding assets and gas tokens on
      multiple chains, which was inconvenient and inefficient.


      #### No Requirement for Centralized Intermediary


      With a blockchain bridge, users can seamlessly move assets from one chain
      to another without the need for a centralized intermediary. The bridge
      ensures that the supply of tokens remains constant across both networks
      during the transfer process. This allows for greater flexibility and
      expands the capabilities of tokens, as they can now migrate across
      different blockchain networks.
