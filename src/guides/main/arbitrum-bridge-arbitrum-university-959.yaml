      ## What is a Blockchain Bridge?


      A blockchain bridge is a protocol that connects two separate blockchain
      networks, allowing for the exchange of tokens and information between
      them. It acts as a link or a bridge that enables cross-chain interactions,
      making the blockchain world more interconnected and collaborative.


      The process of transferring assets through a blockchain bridge usually
      involves a lock and mint <-> burn and unlock system. The bridge locks the
      assets on the source chain, then mints an equivalent number of wrapped
      assets on the destination chain. These wrapped assets can be burned to
      unlock the original assets on the source chain.


      There are various types of blockchain bridges, but most popular ones
      support a wide range of assets and multiple blockchains. They typically
      charge a small fee for the transfer, usually ranging from 0.01% to 0.05%
      of the bridged amount. However, some bridges, especially official ones,
      have zero fees besides the gas costs.


      ## Benefits of Blockchain Bridge


      #### Creating Interoperable Blockchain Ecosystem


      The main purpose of a blockchain bridge is to create an interoperable
      blockchain ecosystem, where different networks can communicate and work
      together. Before the introduction of bridges, each blockchain operated
      independently, and users had to maintain balances on each blockchain they
      wanted to interact with. This meant holding assets and gas tokens on
      multiple chains, which was inconvenient and inefficient.


      #### No Requirement for Centralized Intermediary


      With a blockchain bridge, users can seamlessly move assets from one chain
      to another without the need for a centralized intermediary. The bridge
      ensures that the supply of tokens remains constant across both networks
      during the transfer process. This allows for greater flexibility and
      expands the capabilities of tokens, as they can now migrate across
      different blockchain networks.

      ## Arbitrum Bridge


      The Arbitrum Bridge is a decentralized application (DApp) created by
      Offchain Labs to solve a major problem in the blockchain world:
      transferring assets between the Ethereum main network (Layer 1) and its
      Layer 2 counterpart, Arbitrum One. This bridge acts as a crucial link,
      enabling assets to move seamlessly between these two layers while
      maintaining interoperability.


      The Arbitrum Bridge offers enhanced scalability by offloading Ethereum's
      computational load, enabling faster and more cost-effective transactions
      through batch processing. Its security is rooted in Ethereum's proven
      model, with additional checks and the ability for users to contribute as
      validators. The bridge's user-friendly interface simplifies asset
      transfer, improving the user experience for both novices and experts in
      the crypto realm. It fosters interoperability, allowing assets to move
      across various blockchain networks, thereby broadening user engagement
      with diverse applications. Lastly, its cost efficiency is a standout
      feature, slashing transaction fees and promoting a sustainable blockchain
      environment.


      ## Purpose of Arbitrum Bridge


      #### Facilitating Asset Transfers


      The Arbitrum Bridge plays a central role in facilitating the transfer of
      assets between Ethereum and the Arbitrum One network. Users can deposit
      their ETH or ERC-20 tokens into the bridge contract on Ethereum's Layer 1.
      These assets are then locked, and an equivalent amount is minted on the
      Arbitrum network's Layer 2. The bridge acts as a custodian, ensuring the
      security and integrity of the assets during the transition.


      #### Moving Computational Work


      The Arbitrum bridge operates by moving most of the computational work off
      the Ethereum network (Layer 1) while still maintaining the security
      guarantees of this decentralized blockchain. When a user wants to transfer
      their assets from Ethereum to Arbitrum, they interact with the Arbitrum
      bridge. This process utilizes 'roll-up' technology, which batches multiple
      transactions into a single one, resulting in improved scalability and
      reduced gas fees.


      #### Withdrawals and Dispute Period


      When a user wishes to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum back to
      Ethereum, the tokens on the Arbitrum network are burned, and the
      previously locked assets on Ethereum are released. However, it's important
      to note that Arbitrum employs a security mechanism called the "dispute
      period" for withdrawals. This means that withdrawals are delayed for
      approximately one week to allow the Layer 2 network's state to be
      challenged and verified on Ethereum before the funds are released.

      The Arbitrum bridge allows users to transfer their funds between different
      chains, such as Ethereum and Arbitrum One. This process, known as
      bridging, involves depositing funds from a parent chain to a child chain
      or withdrawing funds from a child chain to a parent chain. In this guide,
      we will provide a step-by-step process for both depositing and withdrawing
      funds using the Arbitrum bridge.


      ## Depositing Funds


      #### Obtain Native Currency

      To bridge assets to another chain, such as from Ethereum to Arbitrum One,
      you must have the parent chain's native currency (e.g., ETH) for the
      transaction. You can acquire this either through a centralized exchange,
      an on-ramp service, or for testnets, via a faucet.


      #### Add Preferred Network to Wallet 

      To bridge assets using a wallet like MetaMask, add your target chain's RPC
      endpoint: open MetaMask, select 'Add Network' at the bottom, and enter the
      network details manually. Information for common Arbitrum chains (Arbitrum
      One, Nova, and Sepolia testnet) includes specific RPC URLs, Chain IDs, and
      currency symbols, with more details available on
      https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers

      </div>



      #### Initiate the Deposit

      To bridge ETH or ERC-20 tokens, visit https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ and
      connect your wallet to the source network. Choose the destination network
      (e.g., Arbitrum One or Nova), and select the token you wish to bridge.

      </div>


      Ensure you have enough ETH for the transaction fee, enter the amount to
      bridge, and confirm the transaction. Funds should transfer within 15-30
      minutes, depending on network traffic. Remember to switch your wallet to
      the destination chain to view your funds upon arrival.

      ## Withdrawing Funds


      #### Log in to the Arbitrum bridge

      Make sure you are logged in to the Arbitrum bridge with your web3 wallet.
      Connect to the source network (the chain from where you want to withdraw
      your assets). Choose the destination network where you want your assets to
      go. For example, if you want to withdraw funds to Ethereum mainnet, select
      Ethereum mainnet as the destination network.

        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1699012297002_withdraw_image%201.png"/>
      </div>


      #### Enter the amount and initiate the withdrawal

      Enter the amount of ETH or ERC-20 tokens you want to bridge in the "From"
      box and click on the "Move funds" button. Ensure that you have enough ETH
      in your wallet to cover the transaction fees.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1699012336404_withdraw_image%202.png"/>
      </div>


      #### Wait for the withdrawal period

      Once you initiate the withdrawal, there is a minimum 7-day withdrawal
      period for networks like Arbitrum One and Nova. During this period, you
      will have to wait for your funds to be transferred back to the parent
      chain. After the withdrawal period is over, switch to the destination
      network on your wallet and press the "Claim" button to receive your funds.
      Make sure to check the status of your withdrawal in the Transactions tab
      of your profile.

      Token bridging allows projects to seamlessly connect their existing Layer
      1 (L1) tokens with the Arbitrum ecosystem. This integration enables the
      transfer of tokens between L1 and Layer 2 (L2) networks, providing
      increased scalability and efficiency. Following are the different ways to
      bridge tokens:


      #### Standard Gateway


      The standard gateway is the simplest method for bridging tokens. By
      choosing this option, an ERC-20 token will be automatically deployed on
      the Arbitrum network, acting as the L2 counterpart to your L1 token. This
      means that whenever a token is deposited on L1, an equivalent amount will
      be minted on L2, and vice versa. To learn more about the standard ERC-20
      gateway and its implementation, refer to the relevant section in the
      conceptual page.


      #### Generic-Custom Gateway


      If you require custom functionality for your ERC-20 token on Arbitrum, the
      generic-custom gateway is the way to go. With this method, you can deploy
      your counterpart token on Arbitrum with unique features tailored to your
      needs. Whether it's implementing specific rules or adding additional
      functionalities, the generic-custom gateway provides the flexibility you
      require. For more information on how to utilize the Arbitrum generic
      custom gateway, refer to the relevant section in the conceptual page.


      #### Custom Gateway


      In certain cases where a custom ERC-20 token is not sufficient, the custom
      gateway offers an additional layer of flexibility. This method is suitable
      when you need more control over the gateway, such as when your token has
      the ability to increase its supply on L2. With the custom gateway, you can
      ensure that L2-minted tokens can be withdrawn back to L1 and recognized by
      the L1 contract. For a detailed understanding of other types of gateways
      and their implementation, refer to the relevant section in the conceptual
      page.


      #### Practical Implementation


      To further assist you in bridging tokens, we provide examples and scripts
      that demonstrate the deposit and withdrawal processes using the Arbitrum
      SDK. These scripts showcase how to programmatically deposit tokens from L1
      to L2 and vice versa. By following the step-by-step instructions outlined
      in the "How to bridge tokens via Arbitrum's standard gateway" section, you
      can easily initiate the bridging process and ensure a smooth transfer of
      tokens between the two networks.
