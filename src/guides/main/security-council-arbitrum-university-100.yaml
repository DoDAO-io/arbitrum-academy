      ## What is Security Council

      The Security Council, as established by the Constitution of the Arbitrum
      DAO, is a pivotal entity tasked with safeguarding the Arbitrum ecosystem.
      This council, composed of 12 members, is elected democratically by the
      Arbitrum DAO's members to manage and mitigate risks. Their role
      encompasses enacting both emergency and non-emergency measures to maintain
      the integrity and security of the network, ensuring the ecosystem's
      resilience against threats and vulnerabilities. Through this governance
      structure, the Arbitrum DAO emphasizes a proactive and responsive approach
      to security, entrusting elected individuals with significant
      responsibility in the stewardship of the platform's safety protocols.

      ## What are elections?

      The election of the Security Council is a key component of the Arbitrum
      DAO's governance framework, serving as a mechanism through which community
      members can shape the leadership that manages the protocol's security.
      Community involvement in these elections is essential to appoint
      representatives who not only embody the community’s values but also
      possess the specialized technical expertise necessary for the role. 


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/security_council_arbitrum_university_100/1701352273980_election_process.png"/>
      </div>


      For members of the Arbitrum DAO, participation in the Security Council
      elections is not just a right but a responsibility that underscores the
      commitment to risk management and the broader goal of progressive
      decentralization. This involvement is critical for sustaining the DAO and
      the technologies under its purview, while also managing expectations and
      perceptions both within the Ethereum community and externally.


      ## Importance of elections

      The significance of the Security Council elections within the Arbitrum DAO
      can be summarized as follows:


      1. **Democratic Representation:** Elections ensure that those responsible
      for the DAO’s security are chosen by the community, upholding democratic
      principles.


      2. **Vigilance and Integrity:** Elected members are tasked with the
      critical role of maintaining the security and integrity of the DAO,
      aligning with the community's trust.


      3. **Alignment with DAO Values:** Regular elections facilitate the
      selection of Council members who embody the values outlined in the DAO’s
      Constitution.

      </div>


      4. **Accountability:** The election process provides a mechanism for the
      removal of any member not acting in the DAO's best interests, ensuring
      accountability.


      5. **Adaptive Governance:** By enabling the community to refresh the
      Council's composition, elections help the DAO adapt to evolving challenges
      and needs.

      ## How elections work?

      The working of the Security Council elections for the Arbitrum DAO is
      explained below:


      ### Members of the Council

      The Security Council consists of 12 members split into two halves.
      Elections to appoint members to each half occur biannually. While each
      member typically serves for a full year, the initial group's terms were
      shortened to account for the time between the first election outlined in
      the Constitution and the actual start date of the DAO. The six candidates
      receiving the most votes are elected to the Security Council. 


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/security_council_arbitrum_university_100/1701354370071_working_of%20elections.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Candidacy Requirements

      The candidates must fulfill the following requirements to qualify for the
      position in the security council:

      1. Candidates must belong to the Arbitrum DAO.

      2. Candidates need backing from holders of at least 0.2% of votable
      tokens.

      4. No more than 3 members from the same organization can be elected.

      5. Candidates must be free of conflicts that could hinder their ability to
      prioritize the DAO's best interests.


      ### Amendments to Election Rules

      Election rules can be changed by DAO members, but not during an ongoing
      election. A Security Council member can be removed if 10% of votable
      tokens participate in a vote with 5/6 majority favoring removal, or if 9
      Council members vote for the removal. The Constitution is the ultimate
      authority on the DAO’s rules, and any discrepancies between other
      documents and the Constitution default to the latter’s precedence.
