      ## What is a Validator?

      In the Arbitrum ecosystem, certain nodes opt to function as validators,
      playing a crucial role in monitoring and advancing the rollup protocol to
      ensure the chain's state progresses securely. These nodes validate the
      actions on the chain by confirming the correctness of inbox messages, thus
      maintaining the integrity of the protocol. Not all nodes are validators;
      some may choose to compute the correct chain behavior independently
      without participating in the consensus mechanism. 


      ### Types of Validators 


      **Active Validator**

      This strategy involves validators proactively participating in the network
      by proposing new rollup blocks and maintaining a constant stake in the
      network to do so. Their main goal is to advance the state of the chain.
      There is typically no need for more than one honest active validator, as
      having more than one can be resource-intensive.


      **Defensive Validator**

      Defensive validators monitor the rollup protocol and only act if they
      detect an incorrect block being proposed. They will then either propose a
      correct block or stake on an existing correct block. This strategy is more
      resource-efficient, as it stakes only when necessary to correct or prevent
      potential dishonest actions.


      **Watchtower Validator**

      Watchtower validators perform a passive monitoring role, where they do not
      stake but keep an eye on the rollup protocol. If they spot an incorrect
      block, they alert other parties so they can take action. It relies on
      other staking parties to intervene before the deadline for the incorrect
      block expires, allowing for a response window of several days.


      ## Validation Strategies


      Validators in the Arbitrum network can adopt several strategies, depending
      on their roles and permissions. These strategies include:


      #### Defensive (allowlist required):

      Validators post stakes and initiate challenges if their local state
      conflicts with the on-chain assertion. This strategy requires a wallet to
      post stakes and will only incur costs if a discrepancy is detected. 


      #### StakeLatest (allowlist required):


      Validators remain staked on the latest assertion, ready to challenge any
      incorrect assertions. This proactive approach requires a wallet and incurs
      some gas expenditure with each new assertion.


      #### ResolveNodes (allowlist required):


      In addition to staying staked on the latest assertion, validators resolve
      any unconfirmed assertions and challenge incorrect ones. This method
      requires a wallet and consumes gas for resolving unconfirmed assertions or
      when a new assertion is created.


      #### MakeNodes (allowlist required):


      Validators continuously generate new assertions and challenge any
      incorrect ones found. This is the most gas-intensive strategy as it
      requires a wallet, consistent staking, and may incur costs from gas spent
      on reverted calls when multiple validators attempt to make a new assertion
      simultaneously. 


      #### Watchtower (no allowlist required):


      This strategy is accessible to all nodes and operates in a monitoring
      capacity. A Watchtower node will log an error if it detects an on-chain
      assertion that diverges from the local computation of the chain state. It
      is a passive strategy that does not engage with the chain directly and,
      therefore, does not require a wallet or incur on-chain expenses. By
      default, all nodes (full and archive) have Watchtower mode enabled.

      ### Default Node Configuration


      - **Watchtower Mode Activation**: Arbitrum nodes, inclusive of both full
      and archive types, are preset to operate in Watchtower mode.


      ### Error Logging


      - **Incorrect Assertion Detection**: When a node in Watchtower mode
      detects an incorrect assertion, it logs an error with the specific phrase
      "found incorrect assertion in watchtower mode".


      ### Log Verification


      - **Watchtower Mode Confirmation**: The presence of a log entry like `INFO
      [09-28|18:43:49.367] running as validator txSender=nil actingAsWallet=nil
      whitelisted=false strategy=Watchtower` confirms that the node is running
      in Watchtower mode.


      ### Log Messages for Validator Operation


      - **L2 Block Validator Check**: The message "validation succeeded" in the
      logs indicates that the L2 block validator is functioning correctly.

      - **L1 Validator Confirmation**: The log entry "found correct assertion"
      signifies that the L1 validator is operational.


      ### Performance Considerations


      - **Overhead**: While Watchtower mode adds a slight amount of execution
      and memory overhead to node operation.


      ### Disabling Watchtower Mode


      - **Deactivation**: If desired, Watchtower mode can be turned off by using
      the configuration parameter `--node.staker.enable=false`.

      ## Validator Wallet Requirements


      #### Watchtower Validators

      Watchtower validators operate without needing a wallet since they do not
      perform any on-chain actions.


      #### Defensive Validators

      Defensive validators require a configured wallet, but it only needs to be
      funded when an incorrect assertion is logged.


      #### Active Validators

      All other validator types need a wallet pre-funded to post stakes
      immediately and to cover recurring costs at regular intervals.


      ## Creating a wallet for an allowlisted validator


      #### Example Command

      - **Nitro Validator Wallet Creation**: The following Docker command
      instructs the Nitro protocol to set up a validator wallet for Arbitrum One
      and then exit:
        ```sh
        docker run --rm -it -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.1.1-e9d8842 --parent-chain.connection.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.staker.enable --parent-chain.wallet.only-create-key --parent-chain.wallet.password="SOME SECURE PASSWORD"
        ```

      #### Wallet File Location and Backup

      - **File Creation and Directory**: The wallet file will be generated in
      the mounted directory within `arb1/wallet/` for Arbitrum One or
      `nova/wallet/` for Nova networks.

      - **Backup Importance**: It is critical to backup the wallet file as it is
      the sole method for withdrawing the staked funds when required.

      ### Setup for Defensive Validators


      #### Wallet Creation

      - **Pre-existing Wallet**: A defensive validator must have a wallet
      created beforehand using the previously outlined steps.


      #### Funding Requirements

      - **Initial Funding Unnecessary**: Wallets for defensive validators do not
      need to be funded right away.


      #### Action on Deviation

      - **Post-Deviation Procedure**: If a deviation is detected, the defensive
      validator will log "bringing defensive validator online because of
      incorrect assertion". It will then require funding to be added to the
      wallet to post a stake and initiate a dispute.


      ### Running a Defensive Validator


      #### Example Command for Arbitrum One

      - **Command to Start Defensive Validator**:
        ```sh
        docker run --rm -it -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.1.1-e9d8842 --parent-chain.connection.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.staker.enable --node.staker.strategy=Defensive --parent-chain.wallet.password="SOME SECURE PASSWORD"
        ```

      ### Validator Verification


      #### Log Verification for Setup

      - **Correct Wallet Setup Indication**: The log message `INFO
      [09-28|18:43:49.367] running as validator txSender=0x...
      actingAsWallet=0x... whitelisted=true strategy=Defensive` indicates a
      correctly set up wallet.
         - **Allowlist Status**: The `whitelisted` flag should be `true`, confirming the wallet is on the allowlist.
         - **Strategy Confirmation**: The `strategy` should read `Defensive`.
         - **Wallet Presence**: `txSender` and `actingAsWallet` should have valid addresses, not be `nil`.

      #### Log Messages for Validator Functionality

      - **L2 Block Validator Check**: The log entry "validation succeeded"
      signifies the L2 block validator's successful operation.

      - **L1 Validator Confirmation**: "found correct assertion" in the logs
      confirms the proper functioning of the L1 validator.
