      ## Why Submit Proposal?

      A DAO proposal is a formalized suggestion put forward by a member of a
      Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which is a community-led
      entity with no central authority, to make changes or take specific actions
      within the organization's ecosystem. The need for such proposals arises
      from the democratic nature of DAOs, where collective decision-making is
      fundamental. Proposals enable innovation, improvements, and community
      consensus on the evolution of the protocol or organization. They are
      essential for the transparent and equitable governance of blockchain-based
      projects, allowing stakeholders to vote and decide on the deployment of
      shared resources and strategic directions.

      ## Types of Proposals 

      There are two distinct categories of AIPs (Arbitrum Improvement Proposals)
      within the Arbitrum DAO framework:


      ### Constitutional AIPs

      These are significant proposals that have the potential to alter the
      foundational rules and procedures of the Arbitrum ecosystem. They include
      changes to the text of the Constitution or to AIP-1, which lays out the
      initial rules for the governance process itself. They can also involve
      installing or modifying software on any of the chains within the Arbitrum
      network or taking actions that necessitate "chain owner" permissions,
      which typically means they require a higher level of authority and
      scrutiny due to their impact on the infrastructure and overall operation.

      </div>


      ### Non-Constitutional AIPs

      This type encompasses proposals that are less structural in nature and do
      not involve amending the Constitution or the foundational governance
      document (AIP-1). They are usually operational or administrative, such as
      requests for funds or grants, or they may offer guidelines or disseminate
      information to the community. Non-Constitutional AIPs are generally more
      straightforward and often deal with the day-to-day governance and
      maintenance of the community's projects and initiatives.


      ## Prerequisites

      To submit a proposal in a DAO the following prerequisites must be met:


      ### For a Temperature Check Using Snapshot:


      1. Possession of an Ethereum wallet address.

      2. The Ethereum wallet must represent at least 0.01% of votable tokens
      within the DAO's ecosystem.


      ### For Submitting a Proposal On-chain Using Tally:


      1. Possession of an Ethereum wallet address.

      2. The Ethereum wallet must represent at least 1,000,000 tokens, which
      equates to approximately 0.1% of votable tokens within the DAO's
      ecosystem.


      If you lack sufficient voting power, there is an option to delegate your
      votes to a delegate with enough tokens. The delegate must have the
      capability and willingness to create a proposal on your behalf.

      ## How to Structure the Proposal?

      When composing an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) for submission to
      the Arbitrum DAO, it is encouraged to follow the structured format below
      to enhance clarity and facilitate the decision-making process:


      1. **Abstract**: Provide a concise summary of the AIP in two or three
      sentences.


      2. **Motivation**: Articulate the reasons for proposing the AIP and why it
      is beneficial for the Arbitrum community.


      3. **Rationale**: Explain how the AIP is in line with the mission and
      values of the Arbitrum community.


      4. **Key Terms** (Optional, but recommended): Define any specialized or
      new terms used within the proposal that are specific to the context or
      industry.


      5. **Specifications**: Offer an in-depth description of the platforms and
      technologies that will be utilized. Discuss the reasoning behind design
      choices, including alternative designs and precedents in other projects.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/submitting_a_dao_proposal_arbitrum_university_385/1701364100110_structure.png"/>
      </div>


      6. **Steps to Implement**: Detail the actionable steps required to execute
      the AIP, along with estimates of costs, manpower, and other necessary
      resources. For AIPs involving third parties, include the necessary legal
      documentation and procedures.


      7. **Timeline**: Outline key dates, including the start date, milestones,
      and expected completion date.


      8. **Overall Cost**: Present a comprehensive cost analysis for
      implementing the AIP, considering both one-time and ongoing expenses.


      For AIPs that require resubmission after an initial rejection, include the
      additional sections:


      9. **Link to the Previous AIP**: Incorporate a reference to the initial
      submission.


      10. **Reasons for Non-Passage**: Summarize why the original AIP was not
      approved.


      11. **Changes Made**: Specify the modifications made to the AIP in
      response to the community's feedback.


      12. **Additional Information**: Provide more details on the intentions,
      specifics, and implications to aid the community in understanding the
      revisions, thereby improving the likelihood of acceptance. 


      Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure that the proposal is clear,
      comprehensive, and aligned with the community's expectations, increasing
      its chances of being favorably received. In the diagram below, find the

      ## Conduct a formal temperature check with a Snapshot poll

      Here are the steps to conduct a formal temperature check with a Snapshot
      poll for the Arbitrum DAO:


      ### Step 1: Post on the DAO Governance Forum

      Draft your proposal, ensuring it aligns with the Arbitrum DAO's goals and
      format guidelines. Go to the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. Create a new
      post and use the provided template to structure your proposal. Feel free
      to add additional context to the template to better explain your proposal.


      ### Step 2: Create a Snapshot Poll

      When your proposal is ready for a temperature check, navigate to the
      Snapshot platform. Connect your Ethereum wallet to Snapshot. Access the
      Arbitrum DAO Snapshot space. Set up a new poll and link it to your forum
      post. The poll should be configured to last for one week and use a simple
      majority to decide its outcome.


      ### Step 3: Engage in Discussion

      Once the poll is created, return to your forum post. Update your post with
      a link to the Snapshot poll so the community can participate. Allow the
      community at least one week to discuss, debate, and vote on your proposal.
      Actively engage with the community and consider their feedback to refine
      your proposal.


      ### Step 4: Review the Results

      If the temperature check does not pass, do not proceed to an on-chain
      vote. Instead, use the feedback to revise your proposal and address
      community concerns in the forum. If the temperature check passes, you can
      prepare for the on-chain voting process. Incorporate any feedback from the
      forum and temperature check discussions into your proposal.


      ### Step 5: Proceed to On-chain Voting

      With a successful temperature check, move on to the on-chain vote using
      Tally. Ensure all relevant feedback has been integrated into the final
      proposal.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/submitting_a_dao_proposal_arbitrum_university_385/1701368318209_submitting_proposals.png"/>
      </div>


      ## Submit your on-chain proposal using Tally

      Here are the steps to submit your on-chain proposal using Tally for the
      Arbitrum DAO:


      ### Step 1: Meet the Token Requirement

      Ensure your wallet contains at least 1,000,000 $ARB tokens, which is
      approximately 0.1% of votable tokens. Log into the Tally website with the
      wallet that holds your $ARB tokens. Go to the "explore DAOs" section or
      select "My DAOs" within your Tally profile. Locate and select the Arbitrum
      DAO's page.


      ### Step 2: Select the Governor

      Click on the "Create new proposal" button. Decide which governor you are
      addressing:
           - **Arbitrum Core**: For Constitutional Proposals.
           - **Arbitrum Treasury**: For non-Constitutional Proposals.

      ### Step 3: Preview and Submit

      Name your proposal and provide a detailed description. Add a preview image
      if you wish (this is optional). Verify you are submitting to the correct
      DAO page on Tally. Define the actions that will be executed if the
      proposal is passed, such as transferring funds to a specific address.
      Review your proposal thoroughly. You can save it as a draft or submit it
      on-chain.


      ### Step 4: Voting Conditions for Passage

      A proposal is considered successful if it meets two conditions:
           - It receives more votes in favor than against.
           - It achieves a minimum favorable vote percentage of the total votable tokens:
             - 5% for a Constitutional AIP.
             - 3% for a non-Constitutional AIP.

      ### Step 5: Stay Engaged and Seek Feedback

      If your proposal passes, celebrate your success! The actions outlined in
      your proposal will be executed on-chain after the specified delay. If your
      proposal fails, but you believe it has potential after revision, gather
      feedback and prepare to resubmit. As the DAO and its governance processes
      are dynamic and evolving, stay active on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum
      or Discord to discuss your proposal and receive input from the community.

      ## How to resubmit a DAO proposal?

      Here's a guide to resubmitting a proposal to the Arbitrum DAO:


      ### Step 1: Revise Proposal

      Assess the community's feedback from your original proposal to understand
      their concerns and objections. Update your proposal with the community's
      input and any new information since the first submission.


      ### Step 2: Resubmit as New

      Approach the resubmission as if it's a new proposal, starting with a fresh
      temperature check on the governance forum. In your resubmission, clearly
      address the issues raised previously, following the proposal structure
      guidelines.


      ### Step 3: Reconsider if Rejected

      If faced with multiple rejections, think about fundamentally revising the
      proposal or conduct more extensive community engagement. Resubmitting a
      proposal is about refining your idea in collaboration with the community
      to enhance its likelihood of acceptance.

      ## The lifecycle of an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP)

      The lifecycle of the proposal phase for an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal
      (AIP) is divided into several distinct phases:


      ### Phase 1: Temperature Check

      Submit the AIP for initial feedback on the Arbitrum DAO governance forum.
      Initiate a Snapshot poll to measure community interest. The poll, which
      lasts 7 days, requires a simple majority without a participation
      threshold. While optional, this phase is a governance best practice and
      influences the formal vote.


      ### Phase 2: Formal AIP and Call for Voting

      Officially submit the AIP on-chain with the required token representation.
      A 3-day discussion period follows the submission for community
      deliberation. The AIP must be designated as Constitutional or
      Non-Constitutional and specify affected chains.


      ### Phase 3: On-chain DAO Vote

      DAO members vote on the AIP directly on-chain. The AIP must receive more
      favorable votes and meet a vote percentage threshold: 5% for
      Constitutional, 3% for Non-Constitutional. An AIP that passes progresses
      to further phases, while a failed AIP concludes here.


      ### Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period

      A 3-day waiting period post-vote allows for objections and fund
      withdrawals. This phase respects the decision-making process by allowing
      stakeholders time to adjust.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/submitting_a_dao_proposal_arbitrum_university_385/1700143955825_screenshot_2023-11-16%20at%207.11.27%20pm.png"/>
      </div>


      ### Phase 5: L2-to-L1 Message

      A message from L2 to L1 confirms the AIP's approval, taking at least 1
      week to finalize. This phase links L2 decisions to L1, ensuring immutable
      record and trust in the DAO's choices.


      ### Phase 6: L1 Waiting Period 

      A 3-day waiting period post-L1 confirmation allows for transaction
      finalization on mainnet. This minimizes risks and ensures smooth
      implementation of the AIP.


      ### Phase 7: Implementation 

      The approved AIP is executed, either directly on L1 or via an L1-to-L2
      transaction. Changes remain active until superseded by subsequent AIPs.
      Extra waiting time can be specified for significant changes, allowing
      stakeholders to prepare. This ensures stability for Arbitrum DAO and
      third-party systems during changes.
