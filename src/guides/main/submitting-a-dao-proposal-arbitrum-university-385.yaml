      ## Why Submit Proposal?

      A DAO proposal is a formalized suggestion put forward by a member of a
      Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which is a community-led
      entity with no central authority, to make changes or take specific actions
      within the organization's ecosystem. The need for such proposals arises
      from the democratic nature of DAOs, where collective decision-making is
      fundamental. Proposals enable innovation, improvements, and community
      consensus on the evolution of the protocol or organization. They are
      essential for the transparent and equitable governance of blockchain-based
      projects, allowing stakeholders to vote and decide on the deployment of
      shared resources and strategic directions.


      ## Types of Proposals 

      There are two distinct categories of AIPs (Arbitrum Improvement Proposals)
      within the Arbitrum DAO framework:


      ### Constitutional AIPs

      These are significant proposals that have the potential to alter the
      foundational rules and procedures of the Arbitrum ecosystem. They include
      changes to the text of the Constitution or to AIP-1, which lays out the
      initial rules for the governance process itself. They can also involve
      installing or modifying software on any of the chains within the Arbitrum
      network or taking actions that necessitate "chain owner" permissions,
      which typically means they require a higher level of authority and
      scrutiny due to their impact on the infrastructure and overall operation.


      ### Non-Constitutional AIPs

      This type encompasses proposals that are less structural in nature and do
      not involve amending the Constitution or the foundational governance
      document (AIP-1). They are usually operational or administrative, such as
      requests for funds or grants, or they may offer guidelines or disseminate
      information to the community. Non-Constitutional AIPs are generally more
      straightforward and often deal with the day-to-day governance and
      maintenance of the community's projects and initiatives.


      ## Prerequisites

      To submit a proposal in a DAO the following prerequisites must be met:


      ### For a Temperature Check Using Snapshot:


      1. Possession of an Ethereum wallet address.

      2. The Ethereum wallet must represent at least 0.01% of votable tokens
      within the DAO's ecosystem.


      ### For Submitting a Proposal On-chain Using Tally:


      1. Possession of an Ethereum wallet address.

      2. The Ethereum wallet must represent at least 1,000,000 tokens, which
      equates to approximately 0.1% of votable tokens within the DAO's
      ecosystem.


      If you lack sufficient voting power, there is an option to delegate your
      votes to a delegate with enough tokens. The delegate must have the
      capability and willingness to create a proposal on your behalf.

      ## How to Structure the Proposal?

      When composing an Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) for submission to
      the Arbitrum DAO, it is encouraged to follow the structured format below
      to enhance clarity and facilitate the decision-making process:


      1. **Abstract**:
         - Provide a concise summary of the AIP in two or three sentences.

      2. **Motivation**:
         - Articulate the reasons for proposing the AIP and why it is beneficial for the Arbitrum community.

      3. **Rationale**:
         - Explain how the AIP is in line with the mission and values of the Arbitrum community.

      4. **Key Terms** (Optional, but recommended):
         - Define any specialized or new terms used within the proposal that are specific to the context or industry.

      5. **Specifications**:
         - Offer an in-depth description of the platforms and technologies that will be utilized.
         - Discuss the reasoning behind design choices, including alternative designs and precedents in other projects.

      6. **Steps to Implement**:
         - Detail the actionable steps required to execute the AIP, along with estimates of costs, manpower, and other necessary resources.
         - For AIPs involving third parties, include the necessary legal documentation and procedures.

      7. **Timeline**:
         - Outline key dates, including the start date, milestones, and expected completion date.

      8. **Overall Cost**:
         - Present a comprehensive cost analysis for implementing the AIP, considering both one-time and ongoing expenses.

      For AIPs that require resubmission after an initial rejection, include the
      additional sections:


      9. **Link to the Previous AIP**:
         - Incorporate a reference to the initial submission.

      10. **Reasons for Non-Passage**:
          - Summarize why the original AIP was not approved.

      11. **Changes Made**:
          - Specify the modifications made to the AIP in response to the community's feedback.

      12. **Additional Information**:
          - Provide more details on the intentions, specifics, and implications to aid the community in understanding the revisions, thereby improving the likelihood of acceptance. 

      Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure that the proposal is clear,
      comprehensive, and aligned with the community's expectations, increasing
      its chances of being favorably received.
