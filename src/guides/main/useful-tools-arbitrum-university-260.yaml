      ## RPC Endpoints

      RPC endpoints facilitate interaction with various Arbitrum chains.
      Sequencer endpoints are limited to `eth_sendRawTransaction` and
      `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` operations.

      ## Tenderly


      Tenderly is a comprehensive Web3 development platform that offers a range
      of tools to help developers debug their decentralized apps (dApps). One of
      the key features of Tenderly is its Debugger, which allows developers to
      analyze smart contracts by examining specific lines of code in a format
      that is easy to understand. This enables developers to quickly identify
      and fix any bugs or issues in their smart contracts.


      #### Simulator

      Another useful tool provided by Tenderly is the Simulator. With the
      Simulator, developers can simulate historical and current transactions
      before sending them on-chain. This allows them to test and debug their
      contracts by modifying relevant parameters and source code. By
      streamlining the debugging process, Tenderly helps developers save time
      and resources while improving the reliability of their smart contracts.
      While Tenderly offers great debugging options, it's important to note that
      there are some limitations when debugging L1-to-L2 messages. This is due
      to the use of custom Geth errors. 


      ## Arbiscan


      Arbiscan is another valuable tool for debugging decentralized apps. It is
      a well-known blockchain explorer and analytics platform that specializes
      in the Arbitrum network. Arbiscan provides VMTrace and Debug tools that
      assist developers and users in understanding the execution of transactions
      on the Ethereum network.


      #### VMTrace

      The VMTrace tool offered by Arbiscan provides a step-by-step visualization
      of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) execution. This allows developers to
      trace the processing of transactions and identify any potential issues
      that may arise. Additionally, the Debug tools provided by Arbiscan offer
      further information such as input data, logs, and events emitted by the
      smart contract during execution. These tools provide developers with
      valuable insights into the behavior of their contracts and help them debug
      any issues that may arise.

      #### Chainlink


      Chainlink is a well-known platform in the Web3 services space that
      specializes in decentralized oracle networks. With Chainlink, developers
      can easily build Ethereum and Arbitrum dApps that connect to various
      off-chain data feeds and APIs. These data feeds can provide a wide range
      of information, such as asset prices, weather data, random number
      generation, and more. By integrating Chainlink into your project, you can
      ensure that your dApp has access to accurate and up-to-date off-chain
      data.


      #### API3


      API3 is a collaborative project that aims to deliver traditional API
      services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and
      trust-minimized manner. One of the key features of API3 is its ability to
      enable Airnodes to push off-chain data to on-chain contracts. This means
      that the data can be directly queried through the Airnode or through
      dAPIs, which are data feeds that provide real-time off-chain data. By
      utilizing API3, developers can seamlessly integrate off-chain data into
      their projects and enhance the functionality of their smart contracts.


      #### Tellor


      Tellor is a decentralized oracle network that incentivizes a
      permissionless network of data reporting and validation. Its main goal is
      to ensure that any verifiable data can be brought on-chain. Tellor
      supports a wide range of data needs, including basic spot prices,
      sophisticated pricing specifications like TWAP/VWAP, Snapshot Vote
      Results, and custom data requirements. By leveraging Tellor, developers
      can integrate reliable and trustworthy off-chain data into their projects,
      making their dApps more robust and secure.


      #### Supra


      Supra is a unique and high-throughput Oracle & IntraLayer toolkit that
      offers a wide range of cross-chain solutions. It includes data oracles,
      asset bridges, automation networks, and more. Supra's main objective is to
      interlink all blockchains, whether they are public (L1s and L2s) or
      private (enterprise). By utilizing Supra, developers can seamlessly
      integrate off-chain data from various blockchains into their projects,
      enabling interoperability and enhancing the overall functionality of their
      applications.
