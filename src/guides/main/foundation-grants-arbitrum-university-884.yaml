      ## What are Foundation Grant Program?

      The Arbitrum Foundation's Grant Program is a strategic initiative designed
      to bolster the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem as per its mission
      statement. Managed by the Arbitrum Foundation and distinct from any grants
      by the Arbitrum DAO, this program aims to disburse funds to projects that
      are likely to contribute significantly to the development and expansion of
      the ecosystem. With a focus on enhancing adoption, strengthening the
      technical framework, and fostering vibrant, sustainable communities, the
      program issues grants in phases, each targeting specific sectors within
      the Arbitrum ecosystem. While the program aligns with and supports the
      DAO's objectives, it is an independent entity, focusing on specific
      opportunities and partnerships to advance the broader use and engagement
      with Arbitrum's technology. Projects not fitting the current phase's
      criteria are encouraged to apply through the DAO's proposal process or
      check back as the program's phases evolve.


      ### Length of Grant Programs

      The Arbitrum Foundation Grants Program is structured as a continuous
      effort with no set termination, featuring an open submission window for
      projects seeking grants, and operates in phases typically lasting around
      three months. These phases continue until the Foundation deems their goals
      accomplished. However, the program does include specified Grant Moratorium
      periods when new applications are temporarily suspended; these pauses in
      grant acceptance are communicated in advance on the program's Notion page.


      ### Eligibility for grant Programs

      The Arbitrum Foundation Grants Program is targeted at projects that
      contribute to, assist with, or support the Arbitrum ecosystem, with the
      scope of eligible applicants determined by the current Phase's focus. As
      these Phases evolve, the particular segments of the ecosystem that are
      invited to apply for grants will also change, ensuring that the program
      remains aligned with the ecosystem's shifting needs and opportunities.
      Projects interested in applying should consult the "Current Grant
      Categories" for the most up-to-date information on eligibility and focus
      areas.


      ## Benefits of Foundation Grants

      The benefits of the Foundation Grants Program for projects in the Arbitrum
      ecosystem include:


      1. Tailored funding that aligns with the project's specific needs, with
      distributions based on the achievement of set milestones, deliverables,
      and detailed budget plans.

      2. Inclusion in the Builders group, which connects grant recipients to a
      community of motivated and enthusiastic contributors within the Arbitrum
      ecosystem.

      3. Opportunities to highlight and promote projects within the broader
      Arbitrum ecosystem after meeting significant milestones or demonstrating
      considerable progress.

      4. Continued engagement and support from the Arbitrum Foundation after the

      opportunities for growth and networking to sustain and expand project
      success beyond the grant period.
