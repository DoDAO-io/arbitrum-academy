      ## What are Foundation Grant Program?

      The Arbitrum Foundation's Grant Program is a strategic initiative designed
      to bolster the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem as per its mission
      statement. Managed by the Arbitrum Foundation and distinct from any grants
      by the Arbitrum DAO, this program aims to disburse funds to projects that
      are likely to contribute significantly to the development and expansion of
      the ecosystem. With a focus on enhancing adoption, strengthening the
      technical framework, and fostering vibrant, sustainable communities, the
      program issues grants in phases, each targeting specific sectors within
      the Arbitrum ecosystem. While the program aligns with and supports the
      DAO's objectives, it is an independent entity, focusing on specific
      opportunities and partnerships to advance the broader use and engagement
      with Arbitrum's technology. Projects not fitting the current phase's
      criteria are encouraged to apply through the DAO's proposal process or
      check back as the program's phases evolve.


      ### Length of Grant Programs

      The Arbitrum Foundation Grants Program is structured as a continuous
      effort with no set termination, featuring an open submission window for
      projects seeking grants, and operates in phases typically lasting around
      three months. These phases continue until the Foundation deems their goals
      accomplished. However, the program does include specified Grant Moratorium
      periods when new applications are temporarily suspended; these pauses in
      grant acceptance are communicated in advance on the program's Notion page.


      ### Eligibility for grant Programs

      The Arbitrum Foundation Grants Program is targeted at projects that
      contribute to, assist with, or support the Arbitrum ecosystem, with the
      scope of eligible applicants determined by the current Phase's focus. As
      these Phases evolve, the particular segments of the ecosystem that are
      invited to apply for grants will also change, ensuring that the program
      remains aligned with the ecosystem's shifting needs and opportunities.
      Projects interested in applying should consult the "Current Grant
      Categories" for the most up-to-date information on eligibility and focus
      areas.


      ## Benefits of Foundation Grants

      The benefits of the Foundation Grants Program for projects in the Arbitrum
      ecosystem include:


      1. Tailored funding that aligns with the project's specific needs, with
      distributions based on the achievement of set milestones, deliverables,

      Milestones and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are fundamental tools in
      measuring the progress and success of projects funded by the Arbitrum
      Foundation's Grant Program.


      ## Milestones

      Milestones mark crucial progress points in a project, such as finishing
      key development stages or reaching specific goals. They are part of the
      planned targets for grant recipients, marking progress in various project
      phases. The Foundation works with recipients to tailor funding to these
      milestones, ensuring both support for the project's advancement and
      accountability in grant use, with a focus on collaborative success and
      milestone-based fund release.


      ### Submission Guidelines

      When crafting milestones for your grant application, follow these
      guidelines to ensure clarity and effectiveness:


      1. **Identify Growth-Based Milestones**: Clearly outline key growth-based
      milestones that reflect significant development points in your project.


      2. **Regular Interval**: Aim for approximately one milestone every 2 to 3
      months throughout your project's development cycle.


      3. **Periodic Submission**: Be prepared to submit detailed milestones
      periodically in the format specified upon approval, which may include a
      Github repository, a product demo, or a Dune Analytics dashboard,
      especially for milestones concerning user growth.


      4. **Content of Milestone Submission**: For each milestone, related to
      your grant request, you should include:
         
      - The specific growth-based milestone and its deliverables.

      - The KPI goal that will be used to gauge success for this milestone.

      - The current progress made towards achieving this milestone.

      - The methodology for measuring the milestone and KPI progress.

      - The anticipated date on which you expect to reach the milestone.


      ## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

      Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are measurable values that continuously
      track a project's progress toward its goals. Unlike the binary nature of
      milestones, KPIs enable ongoing performance evaluation. Customized to each
      project's aims, they help the Foundation assess grant impact, offer
      feedback, and spot issues, contributing to a strong, inventive ecosystem.


      Following are some of the examples for KPIs and Milestones:

      ## What is the Project Lifecycle?

      The lifecycle of a project typically progresses through several distinct
      phases, each with its own set of development goals and milestones:


      1. **Ideation Phase**: Here, the project begins as a compelling idea aimed
      at addressing a specific issue within the ecosystem.


      2. **Proof of Concept Phase**: The project's feasibility is validated
      through market research, competitive analysis, and technical evaluation.
      Initial team assembly focuses on achieving a minimum viable product (MVP),
      and foundational infrastructure such as social media, websites, and
      company registration is established.


      3. **Prototype Phase**: A rudimentary version of the project is developed
      to showcase the concept. Private testing begins, the public presence
      grows, and the team expands as needed. Seed funding may be sought
      post-prototype completion.


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/foundation_grants_arbitrum_university_884/1700148690645_screenshot_2023-11-16%20at%208.29.47%20pm.png"/>
      </div>


      4. **Testing Phase**: A viable but unrefined product undergoes public or
      semi-public testing. Continuous iterations are made based on user
      feedback, with new features being added. Revenue models may start being
      tested, marketing efforts increase, and partnerships are explored.


      5. **Launch Phase**: The project officially launches for public use.
      Development persists to add features and polish the product. This is a
      critical period where community feedback significantly impacts the
      project's direction, and the initial user base starts to form.


      6. **Growth Phase**: The project enters a stabilization period where the
      main development goals have been met. The focus shifts to enhancing user
      engagement and broadening market presence. Funding rounds or partnerships
      may be pursued to fuel expansion, and metrics are implemented to gauge
      impact.


      7. **Maturity Phase**: The project secures a stable position within the
      market with a consistent user base. It becomes self-sustaining, even as
      competition arises. The project may continue as is or pivot towards new
      innovations and goals.
