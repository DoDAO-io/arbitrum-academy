      ## Introduction

      This guide delves into the critical components that developers and
      blockchain enthusiasts rely on to build, debug, and maintain decentralized
      applications and systems. This guide explores RPC endpoint providers, the
      conduits through which we interact with blockchain networks; debugging
      tools, which are indispensable for identifying and rectifying code issues;
      monitoring tools and block explorers, which offer insights and
      transparency into blockchain transactions and states. This guide aims to
      equip you with the knowledge and resources to navigate the landscape of
      blockchain technology effectively.


      ## RPC Endpoints

      RPC endpoints facilitate interaction with various Arbitrum chains.
      Sequencer endpoints are limited to `eth_sendRawTransaction` and
      `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` operations.

      Debugging tools are software applications or utilities used to test and
      debug code. They help programmers to identify and fix bugs or defects
      within software or systems. These tools often provide functionalities such
      as setting breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and
      viewing call stacks to understand the state and flow of an application at
      various points during execution. 


      ## Arbiscan

      Arbiscan is a valuable tool for debugging decentralized apps. It is a
      well-known blockchain explorer and analytics platform that specializes in
      the Arbitrum network. Arbiscan provides VMTrace and Debug tools that
      assist developers and users in understanding the execution of transactions
      on the Ethereum network. Arbiscan is a block explorer that is specifically
      designed for the Arbitrum network. It functions similarly to Etherscan but
      is tailored for exploring and analyzing blocks, transactions, smart
      contracts, and addresses on the Arbitrum Layer 2 scaling solution for
      Ethereum. Users of Arbitrum can utilize Arbiscan to verify transactions
      and contracts on the Arbitrum chain.


      #### VMTrace

      The VMTrace tool offered by Arbiscan provides a step-by-step visualization
      of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) execution. This allows developers to
      trace the processing of transactions and identify any potential issues
      that may arise. Additionally, the Debug tools provided by Arbiscan offer
      further information such as input data, logs, and events emitted by the
      smart contract during execution. These tools provide developers with
      valuable insights into the behavior of their contracts and help them debug
      any issues that may arise.
