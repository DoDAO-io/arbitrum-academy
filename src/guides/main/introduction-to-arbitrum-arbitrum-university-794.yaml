      ## What is Arbitrum


      Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to enhance the Ethereum
      blockchain's scalability and efficiency. It processes transactions
      separately from Ethereum's main chain and utilizes Rollup technology to
      combine multiple transactions into one, increasing throughput and reducing
      costs. Arbitrum maintains compatibility with Ethereum's existing tools and
      smart contracts, allowing for straightforward application deployment.
      Developed by Offchain Labs, it includes the Arbitrum One mainnet, which
      supports smart contract execution with Ethereum network validation. The
      use of Arbitrum significantly lowers transaction fees, making it a
      cost-effective alternative for running decentralized applications and
      smart contracts compared to Ethereum's mainnet.


      ## What is Layer 2 


      Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top
      of an existing blockchain system, known as Layer 1. The primary purpose of
      Layer 2 solutions is to address the scalability and performance issues of
      the main blockchain by handling transactions off the main chain. This
      allows for faster processing times and reduced transaction costs, without
      compromising the decentralized security model of the underlying
      blockchain. Layer 2 solutions include various technologies such as state
      channels, sidechains, and rollups, each with their own approach to
      off-chain transaction handling and subsequently settling the final state
      on-chain.


      ### Benefits of Layer 2


      **Increased Transaction Throughput** 

      By handling transactions off the main chain, Layer 2 can process many more
      transactions per second than the base layer, alleviating congestion.


      **Reduced Costs**

      Transactions on Layer 2 typically incur lower fees because they minimize
      the demand on the network's main chain resources.


      **Improved Speed** 

      Transactions can be completed faster on Layer 2, as they are not subject
      to the longer processing times of the main chain.


      **Enhanced Scalability**

      Layer 2 can scale independently from the main chain, allowing the network
      to support more users and applications without a proportional increase in
      transaction costs or times.


      **Maintained Security**

      Despite processing transactions off-chain, Layer 2 solutions typically
      inherit the strong security guarantees of the underlying main chain.

      ## Roll Ups

      Rollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling solution that execute transactions
      outside the main Ethereum chain (off-chain) but record transaction data on
      the main chain (on-chain). The core idea is to "roll up" or batch many
      transactions into a single one, which is then posted to the main chain.
      This reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed on
      the main chain, significantly increasing throughput and reducing
      transaction fees.


      ### Types of Roll ups

      There are two main types of rollups, each with its own approach to
      validating the batched transactions:


      **Optimistic Rollups**

      These operate on the principle that all transactions are assumed to be
      valid by default. They only execute transaction computations on-chain in
      the event of a challenge. This means that instead of performing
      computation to prove the correctness of transactions upfront, Optimistic
      Rollups post the transactions along with a bond. After a challenge period,
      if no one disputes the transaction batch with a "fraud proof" showing that
      something was wrong, the transactions are considered valid. This method
      allows for significant scaling benefits, but the challenge period can
      introduce a delay in finalizing transactions.


      **Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups)**

      ZK-Rollups bundle transactions and generate a cryptographic proof, known
      as a zero-knowledge proof (specifically, a zk-SNARK or zk-STARK),
      attesting to their validity. This proof is then posted to the main chain,
      where it can be quickly verified. Because the validity of the entire batch
      can be confirmed without executing the transactions individually,
      ZK-Rollups can finalize transactions much more quickly than Optimistic
      Rollups. Additionally, ZK-Rollups enhance privacy since the actual
      transaction data can be kept off-chain.


      ## Optimistic Rollup; How it works?

      Optimistic Rollups operates on the assumption that all transactions are
      honest and valid unless proven otherwise. Here's how they work:


      **Transaction Batching**

      Transactions are executed and processed by a smart contract on a separate
      Layer 2 chain. Rather than each transaction being individually recorded on
      the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1), they are collected into batches.


      **Posting to Layer 1**

      Once a batch of transactions is processed, the new state is posted to the
      main chain along with a "state root" â€” a cryptographic hash that
      represents the cumulative state of all accounts after these transactions.


      **Optimistic Assumption**

      The term "optimistic" comes from the system's trust that transactions are
      valid. No computation or proof of validity is performed at the time of
      posting the batch, which saves on gas fees and time.


      **Challenge Period**

      The transactions are not immediately finalized on the main chain. Instead,
      they enter a challenge period during which they can be disputed. If anyone
      believes that a transaction in the batch is fraudulent, they can submit a
      "fraud proof."


      **Fraud Proofs**

      If a fraud proof is submitted, the Optimistic Rollup protocol will run the
      disputed transaction's computation on the main chain to determine its
      validity. If the transaction is indeed invalid, the batch is rolled back,
      and the party who posted the fraudulent batch may lose their bond or
      collateral.


      **Finalization**

      If the challenge period passes without disputes, or if disputes are
      resolved in favor of the batch's validity, the transactions are considered
      finalized. This period can vary in length but is necessary to ensure the
      security of the system without performing full computation on the main
      chain.
