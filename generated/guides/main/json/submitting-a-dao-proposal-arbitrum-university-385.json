      "content": "## Why Submit Proposal?\nA DAO proposal is a formalized suggestion put forward by a member of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which is a community-led entity with no central authority, to make changes or take specific actions within the organization's ecosystem. The need for such proposals arises from the democratic nature of DAOs, where collective decision-making is fundamental. Proposals enable innovation, improvements, and community consensus on the evolution of the protocol or organization. They are essential for the transparent and equitable governance of blockchain-based projects, allowing stakeholders to vote and decide on the deployment of shared resources and strategic directions.\n\n## Types of Proposals \nThere are two distinct categories of AIPs (Arbitrum Improvement Proposals) within the Arbitrum DAO framework:\n\n### Constitutional AIPs\nThese are significant proposals that have the potential to alter the foundational rules and procedures of the Arbitrum ecosystem. They include changes to the text of the Constitution or to AIP-1, which lays out the initial rules for the governance process itself. They can also involve installing or modifying software on any of the chains within the Arbitrum network or taking actions that necessitate \"chain owner\" permissions, which typically means they require a higher level of authority and scrutiny due to their impact on the infrastructure and overall operation.\n\n### Non-Constitutional AIPs\nThis type encompasses proposals that are less structural in nature and do not involve amending the Constitution or the foundational governance document (AIP-1). They are usually operational or administrative, such as requests for funds or grants, or they may offer guidelines or disseminate information to the community. Non-Constitutional AIPs are generally more straightforward and often deal with the day-to-day governance and maintenance of the community's projects and initiatives.\n\n## Prerequisites\nTo submit a proposal in a DAO the following prerequisites must be met:\n\n### For a Temperature Check Using Snapshot:\n\n1. Possession of an Ethereum wallet address.\n2. The Ethereum wallet must represent at least 0.01% of votable tokens within the DAO's ecosystem.\n\n### For Submitting a Proposal On-chain Using Tally:\n\n1. Possession of an Ethereum wallet address.\n2. The Ethereum wallet must represent at least 1,000,000 tokens, which equates to approximately 0.1% of votable tokens within the DAO's ecosystem.\n\nIf you lack sufficient voting power, there is an option to delegate your votes to a delegate with enough tokens. The delegate must have the capability and willingness to create a proposal on your behalf.",

Discuss the reasoning behind design choices, including alternative designs and precedents in other projects.\n\n6. **Steps to Implement**: Detail the actionable steps required to execute the AIP, along with estimates of costs, manpower, and other necessary resources. For AIPs involving third parties, include the necessary legal documentation and procedures.\n\n7. **Timeline**: Outline key dates, including the start date, milestones, and expected completion date.\n\n8. **Overall Cost**: Present a comprehensive cost analysis for implementing the AIP, considering both one-time and ongoing expenses.\n\nFor AIPs that require resubmission after an initial rejection, include the additional sections:\n\n9. **Link to the Previous AIP**: Incorporate a reference to the initial submission.\n\n10. **Reasons for Non-Passage**: Summarize why the original AIP was not approved.\n\n11. **Changes Made**: Specify the modifications made to the AIP in response to the community's feedback.\n\n12. **Additional Information**: Provide more details on the intentions, specifics, and implications to aid the community in understanding the revisions, thereby improving the likelihood of acceptance. \n\nAdhering to these guidelines will help ensure that the proposal is clear, comprehensive, and aligned with the community's expectations, increasing its chances of being favorably received.

      "content": "Follow along this step to understand how to submit the DAO proposals.\n\n## Conduct a formal temperature check with a Snapshot poll\nHere are the steps to conduct a formal temperature check with a Snapshot poll for the Arbitrum DAO:\n\n### Step 1: Post on the DAO Governance Forum\nDraft your proposal, ensuring it aligns with the Arbitrum DAO's goals and format guidelines. Go to the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. Create a new post and use the provided template to structure your proposal. Feel free to add additional context to the template to better explain your proposal.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Snapshot Poll\nWhen your proposal is ready for a temperature check, navigate to the Snapshot platform. Connect your Ethereum wallet to Snapshot. Access the Arbitrum DAO Snapshot space. Set up a new poll and link it to your forum post. The poll should be configured to last for one week and use a simple majority to decide its outcome.\n\n### Step 3: Engage in Discussion\nOnce the poll is created, return to your forum post. Update your post with a link to the Snapshot poll so the community can participate. Allow the community at least one week to discuss, debate, and vote on your proposal. Actively engage with the community and consider their feedback to refine your proposal.\n\n### Step 4: Review the Results\nIf the temperature check does not pass, do not proceed to an on-chain vote. Instead, use the feedback to revise your proposal and address community concerns in the forum. If the temperature check passes, you can prepare for the on-chain voting process. Incorporate any feedback from the forum and temperature check discussions into your proposal.\n\n### Step 5: Proceed to On-chain Voting\nWith a successful temperature check, move on to the on-chain vote using Tally. Ensure all relevant feedback has been integrated into the final proposal.\n",
