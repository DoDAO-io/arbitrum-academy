      "content": "## What is Arbitrum Nova?\nArbitrum Nova is a variant within the Arbitrum ecosystem that provides a high-performance blockchain solution. Arbitrum Nova operates on the AnyTrust protocol, which is mostly trustless but introduces a new element of trust. The core of this additional trust assumption is the Data Availability Committee (DAC), which has the task of efficiently handling Layer 2 transaction data—storing it, batching it, and then posting it to Ethereum's Layer 1. The presence of the DAC in the AnyTrust protocol is what allows Arbitrum Nova to offer enhanced performance and cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for use cases where these attributes are prioritized. \n\n## What is Anytrust Protocol \nThe AnyTrust protocol is a variation of the Arbitrum Nitro technology designed to reduce costs by incorporating a slight trust assumption. Instead of requiring every node within the Arbitrum network to have access to all Layer 2 transaction data—typically ensured by posting this data on Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust delegates this responsibility to a Data Availability Committee. This committee, comprising multiple members, operates under the assumption that at least two members are honest. Consequently, even if the majority collude, the integrity of data availability is maintained, allowing the rollup protocol to function correctly and reducing the reliance on Ethereum's more costly data posting process.\n\n### Benefits of AnyTrust\nThe benefits of AnyTrust are extensive including:\n\n#### Cost Reduction \nThe protocol diminishes the burden on the Ethereum mainnet by limiting the amount of data posted as calldata, which is the main cost driver in the Arbitrum system. By relying on a Committee to store and furnish data as needed, with protocols in place to manage membership and ensure data integrity through a system of public keys and signature requirements (Keysets), AnyTrust significantly reduces the gas costs associated with data availability. \n\n#### Operational Efficiency \nThe structured management of Keysets, overseen by the L1 KeysetManager contract, adds flexibility and security to the Committee's operation, allowing for smooth membership changes and key updates while ensuring that the data is accessible to anyone with the Keyset hash. This setup fosters a trust-minimized environment that balances efficiency with the decentralized ethos of blockchain systems.",

      "content": "## The AnyTrust Security\nAnyTrust security harnesses a strategic balance between trust and decentralization, elevating the robustness of Arbitrum's rollup infrastructure. By forming a Data Availability Committee, AnyTrust fortifies data integrity and accessibility. It consists of the following components:\n\n### Data Availibility Committee\nThe Data Availability Committee is a specialized group within the AnyTrust protocol framework, tasked with the crucial role of storing and ensuring the accessibility of Layer 2 transaction data for Arbitrum's rollup chain. This committee is comprised of multiple appointed members, operating under the fundamental assumption that at least two members are consistently honest and reliable. The integrity of the system hinges on this assumption, as it guarantees the availability of data, even in scenarios where other members may act maliciously or fail. \n\nThe committee's operation is governed by a set of cryptographic public keys, known as Keysets, which establish the identity and authenticity of member signatures. These Keysets are dynamically manageable via a smart contract on Ethereum's Layer 1, known as the KeysetManager, which tracks and authenticates the current valid set of committee members. This arrangement not only ensures the security and availability of transaction data but also introduces a mechanism for manageable trust, reducing the dependency on Ethereum's mainnet and leading to a more efficient and cost-effective rollup process.\n\n### Data Availibility Certificates\nThe Data Availability Certificate (DACert) is an essential component of the AnyTrust protocol, ensuring data accessibility in the Arbitrum network. A DACert includes a data block's hash, an expiration time, and cryptographic evidence that N-1 Committee members have endorsed it. This evidence comprises the Keyset's hash used for signing, a bitmap of the signatories, and a collective BLS signature. Under AnyTrust’s trust model, a valid DACert guarantees that the data will be available from at least one trustworthy Committee member until the expiration time. \n\nIn contrast to the standard Nitro practice where sequencers post full data on Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust permits posting a DACert as a more gas-efficient alternative. The Layer 1 inbox contract validates the Keyset, while Layer 2 code performs additional checks on the signature and expiration time to ensure the DACert's validity. If the DACert passes these checks, the associated data block is considered available, thereby optimizing the data posting process by reducing the on-chain footprint and maintaining data availability.\n\n### Data Availibility Server \nCommittee members in the AnyTrust protocol operate Data Availability Servers (DAS), which provide crucial infrastructure for data storage and retrieval. The DAS implements two distinct application programming interfaces (APIs):\n\n1. **Sequencer API:** This is a JSON-RPC interface exclusive to the Arbitrum chain's Sequencer, through which the Sequencer submits data blocks to be stored by the DAS. Access to this API is typically restricted to the Sequencer to prevent unauthorized submissions.\n\n2. **REST API:** Available publicly, this HTTP(S)-based RESTful API allows any participant to fetch data blocks using their hash. It is designed to be fully cacheable, and deployments often employ caching proxies or content delivery networks (CDNs) to enhance scalability and mitigate the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n\nWhile the Sequencer API is essential only for Committee members, the REST API's functionality is often supported by other entities as well, contributing positively to the system's robustness. The DAS software itself is versatile, with configuration options that allow data to be stored in various ways—locally on file systems, within a Badger database across multiple backing stores for redundancy. Furthermore, the DAS includes features for enhanced performance and reliability, such as optional in-memory caching utilizing Bigcache or external caching with a Redis instance, catering to the diverse needs of data storage and access in the AnyTrust ecosystem. This multi-faceted approach ensures that data is not only stored securely but is also readily available for validation and use by the network, thus maintaining the continuity and efficiency of the Arbitrum protocol.",

      "content": "## What is a Data Availability Certificate (DACerts)\n### Sequencer Committe Interaction\n### Create Diagram \n\n\n\n\n\nData Availability Certificates (DACerts) are an essential component of AnyTrust, a system that ensures the availability of data in a decentralized network. A DACert serves as proof that a specific block's data will be accessible from at least one honest Committee member until a specified expiration time. It consists of a BLS aggregated signature, which demonstrates that N-1 Committee members have signed the (hash, expiration time) pair. By utilizing DACerts, AnyTrust enhances the trustworthiness and availability of data in the decentralized network. It provides a mechanism to ensure that data blocks can be accessed by at least one honest Committee member, thereby increasing the reliability of the system. DACerts offer a valuable solution for maintaining data availability and integrity in decentralized environments.\n\n#### How is it different from Nitro System? \n\nIn the traditional Nitro system, data blocks are posted on the L1 chain as calldata, and their hashes are committed by the L1 Inbox contract. This allows the data to be reliably read by L2 code. However, AnyTrust introduces an additional option for the sequencer to post a data block on L1: using a DACert to prove the availability of the data.\n\n#### Verification of DACert\n\nWhen a DACert is submitted to the L1 inbox contract, it undergoes validation checks. The contract ensures that the DACert uses a valid Keyset, while other aspects of DACert validity are verified by the L2 code. These checks include confirming that the number of signers meets the requirements of the Keyset and that the expiration time is at least two weeks after the current L2 timestamp. If a DACert is found to be invalid during the validation process, the L2 code discards it and proceeds to the next data block. However, if the DACert is valid, the L2 code reads the associated data block, which is guaranteed to be available due to the DACert's validity.\n\n",
