      "content": "## What is Arbitrum Nova?\nArbitrum Nova is a variant within the Arbitrum ecosystem that provides a high-performance blockchain solution. Arbitrum Nova operates on the AnyTrust protocol, which is mostly trustless but introduces a new element of trust. The core of this additional trust assumption is the Data Availability Committee (DAC), which has the task of efficiently handling Layer 2 transaction data—storing it, batching it, and then posting it to Ethereum's Layer 1. The presence of the DAC in the AnyTrust protocol is what allows Arbitrum Nova to offer enhanced performance and cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for use cases where these attributes are prioritized. \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:600px;margin-bottom:40px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_nova_arbitrum_university_144/1701175411237_anytrust_intro.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n## What is Anytrust Protocol \nThe AnyTrust protocol is a variation of the Arbitrum Nitro technology designed to reduce costs by incorporating a slight trust assumption. Instead of requiring every node within the Arbitrum network to have access to all Layer 2 transaction data—typically ensured by posting this data on Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust delegates this responsibility to a Data Availability Committee. This committee, comprising multiple members, operates under the assumption that at least two members are honest. Consequently, even if the majority collude, the integrity of data availability is maintained, allowing the rollup protocol to function correctly and reducing the reliance on Ethereum's more costly data posting process.\n\n### Benefits of AnyTrust\nThe benefits of AnyTrust are extensive including:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_nova_arbitrum_university_144/1701175449131_faide_anytrust.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n#### 1. Cost Reduction \nThe AnyTrust protocol reduces costs on the Arbitrum system by entrusting a Committee with data storage and distribution, thus minimizing the data posted to Ethereum's mainnet. Through a managed system of public keys and signatures called Keysets, it ensures data integrity while lessening the gas fees typically incurred for data posting.\n\n#### 2. Operational Efficiency \nThe KeysetManager contract on L1 manages Keysets to facilitate secure and flexible operation of the Committee, allowing for easy updates to membership and keys. This ensures data availability and supports a trust-minimized, efficient blockchain ecosystem.",

      "content": "## The AnyTrust Security\nAnyTrust security harnesses a strategic balance between trust and decentralization, elevating the robustness of Arbitrum's rollup infrastructure. By forming a Data Availability Committee, AnyTrust fortifies data integrity and accessibility. It consists of the following components:\n\n### Data Availibility Committee\nThe Data Availability Committee is a specialized group within the AnyTrust protocol framework, tasked with the crucial role of storing and ensuring the accessibility of Layer 2 transaction data for Arbitrum's rollup chain. This committee is comprised of multiple appointed members, operating under the fundamental assumption that at least two members are consistently honest and reliable. The integrity of the system hinges on this assumption, as it guarantees the availability of data, even in scenarios where other members may act maliciously or fail. \n\nThe committee's operation is governed by a set of cryptographic public keys, known as Keysets, which establish the identity and authenticity of member signatures. These Keysets are dynamically manageable via a smart contract on Ethereum's Layer 1, known as the KeysetManager, which tracks and authenticates the current valid set of committee members. This arrangement not only ensures the security and availability of transaction data but also introduces a mechanism for manageable trust, reducing the dependency on Ethereum's mainnet and leading to a more efficient and cost-effective rollup process.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:800px;margin-bottom:50px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_nova_arbitrum_university_144/1701175505035_anytrust_sakoorti.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Data Availibility Certificates\nThe Data Availability Certificate (DACert) is an essential component of the AnyTrust protocol, ensuring data accessibility in the Arbitrum network. A DACert includes a data block's hash, an expiration time, and cryptographic evidence that N-1 Committee members have endorsed it. This evidence comprises the Keyset's hash used for signing, a bitmap of the signatories, and a collective BLS signature. Under AnyTrust’s trust model, a valid DACert guarantees that the data will be available from at least one trustworthy Committee member until the expiration time. \n\nIn contrast to the standard Nitro practice where sequencers post full data on Ethereum's Layer 1, AnyTrust permits posting a DACert as a more gas-efficient alternative. The Layer 1 inbox contract validates the Keyset, while Layer 2 code performs additional checks on the signature and expiration time to ensure the DACert's validity. If the DACert passes these checks, the associated data block is considered available, thereby optimizing the data posting process by reducing the on-chain footprint and maintaining data availability.\n\n### Data Availibility Server \nCommittee members in the AnyTrust protocol operate Data Availability Servers (DAS), which provide crucial infrastructure for data storage and retrieval. The DAS implements two distinct application programming interfaces (APIs):\n\n1. **Sequencer API:** This is a JSON-RPC interface exclusive to the Arbitrum chain's Sequencer, through which the Sequencer submits data blocks to be stored by the DAS. Access to this API is typically restricted to the Sequencer to prevent unauthorized submissions.\n\n2. **REST API:** Available publicly, this HTTP(S)-based RESTful API allows any participant to fetch data blocks using their hash. It is designed to be fully cacheable, and deployments often employ caching proxies or content delivery networks (CDNs) to enhance scalability and mitigate the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n\nWhile the Sequencer API is essential only for Committee members, the REST API's functionality is often supported by other entities as well, contributing positively to the system's robustness. The DAS software itself is versatile, with configuration options that allow data to be stored in various ways—locally on file systems, within a Badger database across multiple backing stores for redundancy. Furthermore, the DAS includes features for enhanced performance and reliability, such as optional in-memory caching utilizing Bigcache or external caching with a Redis instance, catering to the diverse needs of data storage and access in the AnyTrust ecosystem. This multi-faceted approach ensures that data is not only stored securely but is also readily available for validation and use by the network, thus maintaining the continuity and efficiency of the Arbitrum protocol.",

The sequencer sends this batch data along with the expiration time to all Committee members simultaneously via an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface.\n\n### Step 2: Data Storage by Committee Members\nEach Committee member receives the batch and stores the data in its own backing store, using the data’s hash as an index for future retrieval. Committee members then sign the pair consisting of the data’s hash and the expiration time using their individual BLS cryptographic keys.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_nova_arbitrum_university_144/1701175567955_kaam_of%20anytrust.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Step 3: DACert Creation\nThe Committee members send their signatures back to the sequencer. Each returns a signature accompanied by an indicator of successful storage. Once the sequencer receives the required number of signatures, it aggregates them to form a Data Availability Certificate (DACert) for the data batch.\n\n### Step 4: DACert Posting\nThe sequencer posts this DACert to the Layer 1 (L1) inbox contract. The DACert is now available for the AnyTrust Layer 2 (L2) chain software, which can validate the data's availability based on it. If the sequencer cannot obtain the necessary signatures within a specified time frame, it defaults to the traditional rollup method. It then posts the full data directly to the L1 chain, bypassing the Committee. The L2 software is designed to recognize both data formats—either provided through a DACert or posted in full. It processes the data accordingly to continue the chain’s operation seamlessly.\n\nThis process ensures that the AnyTrust protocol can validate blocks efficiently while offering a contingency plan to maintain the chain's integrity and continuity.",

Some of the major differences between two chains are listed in the table below.\n\n\n| Feature               | Arbitrum One (Rollup)                                                        | Arbitrum Nova (AnyTrust)                                               |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Data Authenticity** | Layer 2 transaction data is posted on the Ethereum blockchain.               | Uses AnyTrust technology with a Data Availability Committee (DAC).     |\n| **Trust Assumption**  | Trustless and permissionless, open for anyone to validate.                   | Relies on at least two honest DAC members to operate securely.         |\n| **Gas Price**         | Minimum gas price is 0.1 gwei.                                               | Minimum gas price is 0.01 gwei, potentially 10x cheaper.               |\n| **Scalability**       | Suitable for general use cases.                                              | More scalable, designed for high-load dApps like NFTs and social networks. |\n| **DeFi Protocols**    | Higher TVL with major DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Curve.          | Lower TVL with a focus on gaming and social, includes Sushi and others.   |\n| **Transaction Costs** | Relatively higher due to full data posting on Ethereum.                      | Lower costs due to only posting certificates on Layer 1.               |\n",
