      "content": "## Voting in Arbitrum DAO\nVoting in the Arbitrum DAO represents a critical function in the decentralized decision-making process. It is the means by which $ARB governance token holders can have their say in the direction of the DAO's actions, from proposing amendments to the DAO's Constitution to deciding on the allocation of funds for various projects. This democratic approach is fundamental to the decentralized ethos that underpins the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring that all decisions reflect the collective will of the community rather than the desires of a centralized authority.\n\n## Importance of Voting\nThe necessity of voting lies in several key areas:\n\n1. **Decentralization**: Voting is the cornerstone of decentralized governance. By enabling token holders to vote on proposals, the DAO ensures that the power dynamics remain balanced and distributed across its member base, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few.\n\n2. **Consensus Building**: The voting process facilitates a fair and transparent method for reaching consensus on important issues. It allows for diverse opinions to be heard and considered, ultimately leading to decisions that are in the best interest of the entire DAO and its underlying technologies.\n\n3. **Responsiveness**: Voting ensures that the DAO can respond swiftly to new developments and challenges. As the needs and priorities of the DAO evolve, voting allows for the agile adaptation of strategies and the implementation of new initiatives.\n\n4. **Engagement and Ownership**: By participating in votes, members are actively engaging with the DAO's governance. This not only fosters a sense of community but also gives members a sense of ownership over the DAO's future, as they are directly involved in shaping it.\n\n\n        ",

      "content": "The voting power of an individual is proportional to the number of $ARB tokens they possess. When casting votes, members are encouraged to assess proposals based on these values, ensuring that decisions align with the DAO's overarching goals. In the Arbitrum DAO, the voting process is designed to facilitate community-driven governance through four distinct types of votes:\n\n### Temperature Check\nA temperature check is an initial voting step within the Arbitrum DAO designed to measure community interest in a proposed idea or action before it advances through the governance process. This preliminary assessment is conducted on the Snapshot platform, a decentralized voting interface. To participate in a temperature check, $ARB token holders must possess or represent at least 0.01% of the total votable tokens. The purpose of this step is to ensure that the community sufficiently supports a proposal before dedicating more resources to further discussion and voting. It acts as a community pulse-taking measure, enabling the DAO to filter out proposals that lack substantial backing, thus streamlining the governance process to focus on initiatives with broader interest.\n\n### On-chain Vote\nAn on-chain vote in the Arbitrum DAO occurs after a proposal passes the preliminary temperature check. This vote is conducted on the blockchain via Tally, a governance platform, and can only be initiated by $ARB token holders with at least 1,000,000 votable tokens. For a proposal to pass, it must receive affirmative votes from more than 50% of the voting participants. Additionally, constitutional changes require support from at least 5% of all tokens, while non-constitutional changes need 3%. These specifics ensure that only proposals with substantial community backing are ratified, reflecting the DAO's commitment to a democratic and transparent decision-making process.\n",
