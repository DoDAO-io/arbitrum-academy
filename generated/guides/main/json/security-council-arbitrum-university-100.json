      "content": "## What are elections?\nThe election of the Security Council is a key component of the Arbitrum DAO's governance framework, serving as a mechanism through which community members can shape the leadership that manages the protocol's security. Community involvement in these elections is essential to appoint representatives who not only embody the community’s values but also possess the specialized technical expertise necessary for the role. \n\nFor members of the Arbitrum DAO, participation in the Security Council elections is not just a right but a responsibility that underscores the commitment to risk management and the broader goal of progressive decentralization. This involvement is critical for sustaining the DAO and the technologies under its purview, while also managing expectations and perceptions both within the Ethereum community and externally.\n\n## Importance of elections\nThe significance of the Security Council elections within the Arbitrum DAO can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Democratic Representation:** Elections ensure that those responsible for the DAO’s security are chosen by the community, upholding democratic principles.\n\n2. **Vigilance and Integrity:** Elected members are tasked with the critical role of maintaining the security and integrity of the DAO, aligning with the community's trust.\n\n3. **Alignment with DAO Values:** Regular elections facilitate the selection of Council members who embody the values outlined in the DAO’s Constitution.\n\n4. **Accountability:** The election process provides a mechanism for the removal of any member not acting in the DAO's best interests, ensuring accountability.\n\n5. **Adaptive Governance:** By enabling the community to refresh the Council's composition, elections help the DAO adapt to evolving challenges and needs.",

      "content": "## How elections work?\nThe working of the Security Council elections for the Arbitrum DAO is explained below:\n\n### Members of the Council\nThe Security Council consists of 12 members split into two halves. Elections to appoint members to each half occur biannually. While each member typically serves for a full year, the initial group's terms were shortened to account for the time between the first election outlined in the Constitution and the actual start date of the DAO. The six candidates receiving the most votes are elected to the Security Council. \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/security_council_arbitrum_university_100/1700069994657_screenshot_2023-11-15%20at%2010.38.36%20pm.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Candidacy Requirements\nThe candidates must fulfill the following requirements to qualify for the position in the security council:\n1. Candidates must belong to the Arbitrum DAO.\n2. Candidates need backing from holders of at least 0.2% of votable tokens.\n4. No more than 3 members from the same organization can be elected.\n5. Candidates must be free of conflicts that could hinder their ability to prioritize the DAO's best interests.\n\n### Amendments to Election Rules\nElection rules can be changed by DAO members, but not during an ongoing election. A Security Council member can be removed if 10% of votable tokens participate in a vote with 5/6 majority favoring removal, or if 9 Council members vote for the removal. The Constitution is the ultimate authority on the DAO’s rules, and any discrepancies between other documents and the Constitution default to the latter’s precedence.",
