      "content": "## What is Arbitrum DAO \nThe Arbitrum DAO is a collective that governs the Arbitrum ecosystem, which operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It represents the interests of $ARB token holders, enabling them to shape the ecosystem by proposing and voting on Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Governance is executed via smart contracts on the Arbitrum One rollup, a Layer 2 solution enhancing Ethereum's scalability. It is a pivotal structure that empowers decentralized decision-making and the stewardship of the Arbitrum network's future, reflecting the collective will of its participants.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_dao_arbitrum_university_613/1701282781379_dao.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nThe DAO's treasury, also managed through smart contracts, funds the development and maintenance of the platform. Moreover, the DAO oversees a Security Council, elected biannually by the members, to address urgent security matters swiftly, ensuring the ecosystem's safety and reliability.\n\n## Why is it important?\nThe transition to decentralized governance of Arbitrum's technology is a crucial advancement towards empowering the community to oversee the scaling solutions of Ethereum. This development harmonizes the objectives of the Arbitrum community with the broader Ethereum community. It is important due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Ensuring that decision-making processes are democratic and reflect the collective will, rather than being reliant on a select few.\n\n2. Holding $ARB tokens signifies a vested interest in the decentralized progression of both Arbitrum and Ethereum. Token holders are afforded the opportunity to collaboratively guide the expansion and scaling of Ethereum's ecosystem.\n\n3. Being an $ARB token holder places you at the forefront of innovative governance models with significant implications for society. It ensures that your perspective is valued and permanently recorded.\n\n## What is $ARB?\nThe $ARB token is a digital asset based on the ERC-20 standard, which grants holders the right to participate in the governance of the Arbitrum ecosystem through the Arbitrum DAO. This token is created on the Arbitrum One rollup chain, which operates as a Layer 2 solution enhancing Ethereum's capabilities. $ARB token holders play an integral part to oversee the management of the governance protocols and the technological infrastructure of the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains. Token holders use their $ARB to vote on proposals that dictate the networks' upgrades and the allocation of the DAO's funds.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_dao_arbitrum_university_613/1701282804872_arbs_token.png\"/>\n</div>\n\nVoting power in the Arbitrum DAO is proportional to the amount of $ARB tokens one holds or controls through delegation. This means that votes are weighted based on the number of tokens, with more tokens translating to a greater influence on the outcome of proposals. $ARB tokens can also be delegated, allowing token holders to entrust their voting power to others, which is particularly useful for members who may not be actively involved in the day-to-day governance activities. These minting events are also subject to governance through the DAO's proposal system.\n\n### $ARB vs $Eth\nIt is important to understand the similarities and differences between the two tokens. \n\n**Similarities**\n1. Both are powered by decentralized blockchain technology.\n2. Both can be owned by any cryptocurrency wallet that supports $ETH.\n3. Both can be bought, sold, and traded.\n\n**Differences**\n1. $ETH is a transactional token, while $ARB is a governance token.\n2. $ETH is used to pay for transaction fees, while $ARB is not.\n3. Governance of Arbitrum is facilitated by $ARB and governance smart contracts, while Ethereum's governance is handled socially.\n4. Holding $ARB gives you the ability to govern Arbitrum, while holding $ETH doesn't impact your ability to govern Ethereum's protocol.",

It holds the overarching governance responsibilities for the Arbitrum ecosystem, including the election and oversight of the Security Council. The DAO has the power to shape the council's role through constitutional proposals, which can redefine or revoke the council's authority if deemed necessary for the community's interest.\n\n## Decision Making by Arbitrum Governance\nThe Arbitrum governance system holds the crucial role of deciding on upgrades to the core contracts of Arbitrum chains that govern the network's protocols. These upgrades can be driven by various motivations such as performance enhancements, security fixes, or broader ecosystem improvements.\n1. An upgrade could improve the system in some way, like increase its decentralization or optimize its performance and lower fees.\n2. An upgrade could fix a critical vulnerability.\n3. An upgrade could address a non-critical decision that affects the Arbitrum ecosystem at large.\n4. The Arbitrum DAO is also responsible for authorization of the creation of new L2 chains",
