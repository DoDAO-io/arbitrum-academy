      "content": "## What is Arbitrum Bridge?\nThe Arbitrum Bridge is a sophisticated mechanism that connects Ethereum's mainnet (Layer-1) with the Arbitrum chains (Layer-2), allowing for the secure and efficient transfer of assets like ETH and ERC-20 tokens. It enhances scalability by handling a greater volume of transactions and mitigates congestion on the mainnet. The bridge is cost-effective, grouping transactions to reduce gas fees significantly. Security is paramount, with Ethereum's security model integrated and additional safeguards against malicious actions by validators. The bridge supports a wide range of assets, ensuring broad interoperability, and maintains decentralization by allowing open participation of validators. With a user-friendly interface, it simplifies asset transfer across layers, aligning with Arbitrum's goal to improve the Ethereum ecosystem's functionality and user experience.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1701191668148_arbitrum_bridge.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n## How do Bridges Work?\nBridges like the Arbitrum bridge work by transferring the computational workload from Ethereumâ€™s main network (Layer 1) to the Arbitrum network (Layer 2). This transfer is done while maintaining the security features of Ethereum. Here's how it happens:\n\n### Minting Assets\nWhen users want to move their assets, such as ETH or ERC-20 tokens, to Layer 2, they interact with the Arbitrum bridge. The bridge locks the user's assets into a smart contract on Ethereum, meaning those assets can't be moved within Layer 1 anymore. At the same time, an equivalent amount of these assets is created or \"minted\" on the Arbitrum network, which users can freely move and use. This minting process uses roll-up technology, which bundles many transactions into one. This batching reduces the amount of processing Ethereum has to do, which saves on transaction fees, known as gas fees, and allows for more transactions to be processed at once, thereby increasing scalability.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:700px;margin-bottom:50px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1701191705179_working_of%20bridge.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### Burning Assets \nFor withdrawals from Arbitrum back to Ethereum, the process is reversed but includes an additional security step. The tokens on Arbitrum are burnt, meaning they are destroyed to prevent double-spending. Correspondingly, the smart contract on Ethereum releases the initially locked funds. This transaction is not immediate due to a \"dispute period,\" a week-long delay that allows for challenges and verification of the transaction's legitimacy on Ethereum before the assets are unlocked. This delay ensures the integrity and security of the withdrawal process, safeguarding the assets as they transition from Layer 2 back to Layer 1.",

      "content": "Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) bridging enables the movement of assets from the main Ethereum blockchain to secondary frameworks, reducing congestion and fees. The Arbitrum bridge carries out the following processes between Layer 1 and Layer 2:\n\n## L1 contracts can submit L2 transactions\nA contract on Layer 1 (L1) can initiate a transaction on Layer 2 (L2) through the Nitro chain's inbox contract on Ethereum, similar to how a user might. This transaction is queued to be processed on L2, with its outcomes remaining inaccessible to the initiating L1 contract. While the transaction occurs on L2, the initiator on L1 is unable to view any resulting actions. This approach benefits from being straightforward and exhibiting low delay. \n\nHowever, it has a drawback where the L2 transaction may fail if the initiating L1 contract does not accurately set the L2 gas price and maximum gas limit. The lack of visibility for the L1 initiator means there's no certainty that the L2 transaction will complete without issues. This limitation poses a significant risk for specific L1 to L2 transaction types. For instance, in a scenario where a token deposit occurs on L1 for accessibility at an L2 address, a successful L1 transaction followed by a failed L2 transaction results in tokens being locked in the L1 inbox contract with no way to recover them on either layer, which is problematic.\n\n## L1 to L2 ticket-based transactions\nThe ticket-based system for L1 to L2 transactions provides a more reliable alternative to standard calls by mitigating gas-related failures. An L1 contract can issue a \"retryable\" transaction, which the Nitro chain attempts to execute on L2. If it fails, a \"ticketID\" is created for the failed transaction. This ticket can later be used by anyone to attempt the transaction again by calling a specific contract on L2 with the ticketID. The transaction details are stored, and the associated value is reserved from the sender's account. Successful redemption completes the transaction and invalidates the ticketID, while a failure allows for future redemption attempts. This method ensures that the transaction has a chance to succeed eventually, provided someone is willing to redeem the ticket, with costs known upfront and determined by the data size of the transaction. Tickets are valid for about a week, ensuring that the transaction won't be lost if it doesn't go through initially.\n\n## L2 to L1 ticket-based calls\nInteractions from Layer 2 (L2) to Layer 1 (L1) utilize a ticket-based mechanism. An L2 contract can request a transaction on L1 by invoking a function on the ArbSys precompiled contract. Once the L2 submission is verified on L1, which can take several days, a ticket is generated within the L1 outbox contract. This ticket can be activated by anyone who calls a specific method on the L1 outbox and provides the ticketID. A ticket is considered successfully redeemed if the corresponding L1 transaction executes without failure.\n\nThe tickets for these L2-to-L1 transactions are perpetual, remaining valid until they are redeemed. They incur no ongoing fees because they are stored as a Merkle hash in the Ethereum storage, which is permanent and does not charge rent. The initial storage costs for these ticket Merkle roots are financed by the fees from L2 transactions.",

In this guide, we will provide a step-by-step process for both depositing and withdrawing funds using the Arbitrum bridge.\n\n## Depositing Funds\n\n#### Obtain Native Currency\nTo bridge assets to another chain, such as from Ethereum to Arbitrum One, you must have the parent chain's native currency (e.g., ETH) for the transaction. You can acquire this either through a centralized exchange, an on-ramp service, or for testnets, via a faucet.\n\n#### Add Preferred Network to Wallet \nTo bridge assets using a wallet like MetaMask, add your target chain's RPC endpoint: open MetaMask, select 'Add Network' at the bottom, and enter the network details manually. Information for common Arbitrum chains (Arbitrum One, Nova, and Sepolia testnet) includes specific RPC URLs, Chain IDs, and currency symbols, with more details available on https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1699011863312_arbitrum_step%202.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n\n#### Initiate the Deposit\nTo bridge ETH or ERC-20 tokens, visit https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ and connect your wallet to the source network.

For example, if you want to withdraw funds to Ethereum mainnet, select Ethereum mainnet as the destination network.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1699012297002_withdraw_image%201.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n#### Enter the amount and initiate the withdrawal\nEnter the amount of ETH or ERC-20 tokens you want to bridge in the \"From\" box and click on the \"Move funds\" button. Ensure that you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the transaction fees.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1699012336404_withdraw_image%202.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n#### Wait for the withdrawal period\nOnce you initiate the withdrawal, there is a minimum 7-day withdrawal period for networks like Arbitrum One and Nova. During this period, you will have to wait for your funds to be transferred back to the parent chain. After the withdrawal period is over, switch to the destination network on your wallet and press the \"Claim\" button to receive your funds. Make sure to check the status of your withdrawal in the Transactions tab of your profile.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1699012382443_withdraw_image%203.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n",

      "content": "Token bridging allows projects to seamlessly connect their existing Layer 1 (L1) tokens with the Arbitrum ecosystem. This integration enables the transfer of tokens between L1 and Layer 2 (L2) networks, providing increased scalability and efficiency. Following are the different ways to bridge tokens:\n\n#### Standard Gateway\n\nThe standard gateway is the simplest method for bridging tokens. By choosing this option, an ERC-20 token will be automatically deployed on the Arbitrum network, acting as the L2 counterpart to your L1 token. This means that whenever a token is deposited on L1, an equivalent amount will be minted on L2, and vice versa. To learn more about the standard ERC-20 gateway and its implementation, refer to the relevant section in the conceptual page.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px\" src=\"https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/arbitrum-university/Guide/arbitrum_bridge_arbitrum_university_959/1701192561429_how_to%20bridging%20tokens.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n#### Generic-Custom Gateway\n\nIf you require custom functionality for your ERC-20 token on Arbitrum, the generic-custom gateway is the way to go. With this method, you can deploy your counterpart token on Arbitrum with unique features tailored to your needs. Whether it's implementing specific rules or adding additional functionalities, the generic-custom gateway provides the flexibility you require. For more information on how to utilize the Arbitrum generic custom gateway, refer to the relevant section in the conceptual page.\n\n#### Custom Gateway\n\nIn certain cases where a custom ERC-20 token is not sufficient, the custom gateway offers an additional layer of flexibility. This method is suitable when you need more control over the gateway, such as when your token has the ability to increase its supply on L2. With the custom gateway, you can ensure that L2-minted tokens can be withdrawn back to L1 and recognized by the L1 contract. For a detailed understanding of other types of gateways and their implementation, refer to the relevant section in the conceptual page.",
