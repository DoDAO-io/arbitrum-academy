      "content": "The following hardware and software are required to run a full node:\n\n### Minimum Hardware Configurations\nThe bare minimum hardware setup demands 8-16 GB of RAM and a 2-4 core CPU, akin to AWS's t3 xLarge instance. A crucial aspect is the storage, with at least 1.2TB of SSD capacity required, and it's important that this storage can be expanded as the Nitro blockchain is projected to swell by approximately 3GB daily. Keep in mind that as the blockchain expands, these minimum storage specifications will rise, so opting for hardware exceeding these minimums is advisable for maintaining a resilient full node.\n\n### Prerequisites \nThe recommended practice is to employ the latest Docker image specified by `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.1.1-e9d8842`. For the Arbitrum One network, it is essential to begin with a database snapshot, which establishes the historical state of the blockchain. This snapshot can be integrated via the ``--init.url`` parameter on the node's first run, where an example snapshot might be located at `https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar`. This local snapshot can be referenced by using the `--init.url` parameter with a file URI scheme, such as ``--init.url=\"file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/snapshot-file.tar\"``. \n\n### ",
